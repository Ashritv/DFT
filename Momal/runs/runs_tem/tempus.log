    "\fB-output_as_tcl\fR"
    Displays
    the
    output
    as
    a
    TCL
    list
    instead
    of
    displaying
    as
    a
    text.
    
    
    "\fB-relativeDistToSink
    <value>\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    location
    of
    the
    buffer
    instance
    based
    on
    its
    (relative)
    distance
    from
    the
    sink
    pin.
    The
    value
    is
    a
    number
    between
    0
    and
    1
    (both
    inclusive).
    A
    low
    value
    (such
    as
    0.1)
    places
    the
    buffer
    near
    the
    sink.
    A
    high
    value
    (such
    as
    0.9)
    places
    the
    buffer
    near
    the
    driver.
    You
    can
    use
    the
    value
    0
    to
    do
    sink
    term
    buffering
    and
    value
    1
    to
    do
    driver
    term
    buffering.
    The
    fraction
    is
    based
    on
    the
    length
    of
    the
    wire.
    Fractional
    values
    can
    only
    be
    specified

    (with
    one
    common
    net)
    that
    would
    be

    Specifies
    the
    active
    analysis
    views
    for
    which
    timing
    must
    be
    evaluated.
    If
    this

    "\fB-noNewPort\fR"
    Prohibits
    the
    tool
    from
    creating
    hierarchical
    ports
    when
    it
    attaches
    a

    If
    the
    terminal
    cannot
    connect
    to
    the
    net
    through
    existing
    ports,
    the
    tool
    displays
    an
    error
    message
    and
    the
    command
    stops.
    
    "\fB-pin
    ref_inst_nameref_pin_name\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    pin
    <refPinName>on
    instance
    <refInstName>connected
    to
    the
    net
    that
    the
    tool
    connects
    to
    the
    terminal.
    You
    cannot
    specify
    the
    -port
    parameter
    if
    you
    use
    this
    parameter.
    
    "\fB-port
    port_name\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    hierarchical
    port
    used
    to
    connect
    the

    the
    net.
    If
    you
    specify
    this
    parameter,
    the
    hierarchical
    port
    must
    exist

    } .P Creates a named delay calculation corner object that
    can be referenced later when creating an analysis view. A
    delay calculation corner provides all of the information
    necessary to control delay calculation for a specific view.
    Each corner contains information on the libraries to use,
    the operating conditions with which the libraries should
    be accessed, and the RC extraction parameters to use for
    calculating parasitic data. Delay corner objects can be shared
    by multiple top-level analysis views. .P Use separate delay
    calculation corners to define Best-Case and Worst-Case differences.
    Use the -early_* and -late_* parameters within a single delay
    calculation corner to control on-chip variation. .P Note:
    A single delay calculation corner object specifies the delay
    calculation rules for the entire design. If a design includes
    power domains, the delay calculation corner can contain domain-specific
    subsections that specify the required operating condition
    information, and any necessary timing library rebinding for
    the power domain. Use the update_delay_corner command to
    add a power domain definition to a delay calculation corner.

     "\fB-late_opcond <opcondName>\fR" Specifies the operating
    condition to use for calculating late arrival times at a
    single delay corner.  This parameter is used primarily when
    configuring the multi-mode multi-corner environment for on-chip-variation
    (OCV) analysis.  Default: Each library in the late library
    set uses its own default operating condition.  "\fB-late_opcond_library
    <libName>\fR" Specifies the internal library name for the
    library in which the late operating condition is defined.
    This is not the library file name.  This parameter is used
    primarily when configuring the multi-mode multi-corner environment

    an ECSM-based multi-library interpolation , you should specify
    a Tcl list of library_set, such as:  create_delay_corner
    -name dc_P1_T1  -library_set {p1_v1_t1
    
    p1_v2_t1

    analysis modes.  Default: Each library in the library set
    uses its own default operating condition.  "\fB-opcond_library
    <libName>\fR" Specifies the internal library name for the
    library in which the operating condition is defined. This
    is not the library file name.  This parameter is used primarily

    Specifies the RC corner object to associate with this delay
    corner object.  This parameter is used primarily to configure
    OCV and Best-Case Worst-Case (BC-WC) analysis modes.  "\fB-si_enabled {true
    |
    false}\fR" Controls signal integrity (SI) analysis.  When
    set to true, the analysis of all MMMC views will include
    SI analysis by default. You can use this parameter to further
    determine which analysis views receive SI analysis and which
    do not.  When this parameter is set to false on a delay corner,
    the software will disable SI analysis for all the views that
    reference that corner. By default (or when this parameter
    is set to true), SI analysis is computed for all the views
    related to that corner - whenever SI is globally enabled.
    (The global control of signal integrity (SI) analysis is
    determined by the set_delay_cal_mode -SIAware setting.) 
    "\fB-temp_file <tempName>\fR" Specifies the name of the temperature
    file for temperature aware delay calculation for single corner.

    considers
    the
    combinational
    paths
    for
    the
    generated
    clock.
    If
    there
    are
    no
    combinational
    latency
    paths
    for
    the
    generated
    clock,
    the
    generated
    clock
    does
    not
    inherit
    latency
    from
    its
    parent
    clock
    hierarchy.
    
    By
    default,
    when
    calculating
    the
    latency
    of
    a
    generated
    clock,
    the
    software
    searches
    for
    the
    longest
    (and
    shortest)
    paths
    from
    the
    parent
    waveform
    to
    the
    generated
    clock
    point.
    All
    paths
    are
    considered,
    including
    those
    which
    traverse
    sequential
    elements
    such
    as
    flip-flops,
    registers,
    and
    latches.
    The
    default
    behavior
    is
    intended
    for
    cases
    where
    there
    is
    a
    cascade
    of
    generated
    clocks,
    and
    some
    of
    the
    clocks
    are
    not
    explicitly
    defined.
    
    The
    -combinational
    option
    can
    be
    used
    in
    conjunction
    with
    the
    -multiply_by,
    -divide_by,
    or
    -edges
    options.
    
    "\fB-comment
    <string>\fR"
    Allows
    you
    to
    insert
    comments.
    The
    comments
    are
    read
    but
    are
    ignored
    with
    a
    one-time
    warning
    message.
    They
    are
    not
    used
    during
    timing
    analysis
    reporting
    nor
    are
    they
    written
    out
    during
    saving
    of
    constraints.
    
    "\fB-divide_by
    <integer>\fR"
    Determines
    the
    frequency
    of
    the
    new
    clock
    by
    dividing
    the
    frequency
    of
    the
    source
    clock
    by
    <dfactor>.
    For
    example,
    if
    <dfactor=5>,
    the
    new
    frequency
    is
    1/5
    of
    the
    source
    frequency,
    and
    the
    new
    clock
    period
    is
    5
    times
    the
    source
    clock
    period.
    
    "\fB-duty_cycle
    <percent>\fR"
    Sets
    the
    duty
    cycle
    (high
    pulse
    width
    or
    clock
    period).
    The
    number
    (<percent>)
    is
    between
    0
    and
    100.
    For
    example,
    if
    <percent=50>,
    the
    high
    pulse
    width
    of
    the
    new
    clock
    waveform
    is
    the
    same
    as
    its
    low
    pulse
    width.
    
    Note:
    The
    -duty_cycle
    option
    can
    only
    be
    used
    with
    the
    -multiply_by
    option,
    otherwise
    it
    will
    be
    ignored
    with
    a
    warning.
    
    "\fB-edges
    <edge_list>\fR"
    Selects
    a
    list
    of
    edges
    from
    the
    source
    clock
    that
    form
    the
    edges
    of
    the
    derived
    clock.
    See
    the
    frequency
    division
    example
    below.
    
    "\fB-edge_shift
    <edge_shift_list>\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    amount
    of
    shift
    for
    each
    edge
    in
    the
    <edge_list>option.
    The
    amount
    of
    shift
    will
    be
    in
    library
    time
    units.
    
    "\fB-invert\fR"
    Inverts
    the
    source
    clock.
    Use
    with
    the
    -source
    option
    and
    the
    -multiply_by
    or
    -divide_by
    options.
    
    "\fB-master_clock
    <source_clock_name>\fR"
    Generates
    a
    target
    clock
    from
    the
    specified
    clock
    name.
    If
    you
    specify
    the
    -master_clock
    option
    and
    multiple
    signals
    arrive
    at
    the
    source
    pin,
    the
    clock
    specified
    by
    this
    option
    is
    used
    to
    generate
    the
    target
    clock.
    Use
    the
    -add
    parameter
    along
    with-master_clock
    parameter
    to
    add
    a
    clock
    to
    the
    existing
    clock
    when
    you
    want
    to
    specify
    multiple
    clocks
    on
    the
    same
    source
    for
    simultaneous
    analysis.
    
    "\fB-multiply_by
    <integer>\fR"
    Determines
    the
    frequency
    of
    the
    new
    clock
    by
    multiplying
    the
    frequency
    of
    the
    source
    clock
    by
    <mfactor>.
    For
    example,
    if
    <mfactor=4>,
    the
    new
    frequency
    is
    4
    times
    the
    source
    frequency,
    and
    the
    new
    clock
    period
    is
    1/4
    of
    the
    source
    clock
    period.
    
    "\fB-name
    <clock_signame>\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    name
    for
    the
    generated
    clock.
    
    Default:
    The
    system
    creates
    a
    name
    for
    you.
    
    Always
    specify
    a
    name
    for
    the
    generated
    clock.
    Some
    commands
    issue
    an
    error
    if
    you
    use
    the
    system-generated
    name.
    
    "\fB-source
    <source_pin>\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    name
    of
    the
    source
    pin
    from
    which
    the
    new
    clock
    is
    to
    be
    derived.
    This
    is
    a
    mandatory
    option.
    
    "\fB<target_pin_list>\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    list
    of
    pins
    where
    the
    generated
    clock
    assertion
    is
    applied.
    The
    clock
    signal
    propagating
    downstream
    from
    each
    of
    these
    pins
    becomes
    associated
    with
    the
    generated
    clock.

    timing
    libraries
    that
    are
    characterized
    at
    different
    voltages
    (typically
    the
    lower
    and
    upper
    voltage
    bounds,
    and
    a
    third
    intermediate
    point).
    All
    voltages
    required
    by
    the
    software
    will
    be
    interpolated
    from
    this
    set
    of
    libraries.
    The
    libraries
    in
    the
    set
    can
    differ
    only
    in
    the
    characterization
    voltage;
    they
    must
    be
    identical
    to
    each
    other
    in
    all
    other
    aspects.
    However,
    if
    you
    want
    to
    perform
    multi-temperature
    based
    library
    interpolation,
    you
    can
    use
    two
    library
    files
    that
    are
    characterized
    at
    different
    temperatures
    for
    each
    voltage
    value.

    The

    can

    input port to the data input port. .P To create a new timing
    check arc which does not already exist in the timing model,
    the clock port that you specify as -from should be created
    as a clock type by the create_ptm_port command. .P Note:
    The create_ptm_constraint_arc command can be specified only
    after you create a PTM model using the create_ptm_model command.
    .P Parameters    "\fB-edge { rise | fall }\fR" Specifies
    which transition on the clock input is relevant for the timing
    check arc definition.  "\fB-from <c><lock_port_name>\fR"
    Specifies the name of the clock port, which can be an input,
    bidirectional, or internal port.  Note: This parameter allows
    you to specify a pattern for port names using wildcard characters.
     "\fB-hold\fR" Specifies that the check arc to be created
    is of hold type.  "\fB-path_type <pathTypeName>\fR" Specifies
    the reference time arc created using the create_ptm_path_type
    command. This parameter is mutually exclusive to the -value
    parameter currently available. Either the -value parameter
    or the -path_type parameter must be specified.  "\fB-path_factor
    <value>  \fR" Used as an additional scaling value for the
    delay/slew tables.  Default: 1.0  "\fB-setup \fR" Specifies
    that the check arc to be created is of setup type.  "\fB-to
     <port_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the input or bidirectional
    port which will be the signal pin for check arc. If you do
    not specify a port name, the software sets the timing check
    for all input and bidirectional data ports.  Note: This parameter
    allows you to specify a pattern for port names using wildcard

    The
    num_clock_pulse
    <integer>
    holds
    significance
    in
    case
    of
    sequential
    arcs,
    and
    specifies
    where
    to
    align
    the
    data
    pin
    transition
    with
    respect
    to
    the
    clock
    transition.
    
    
    For
    example,
    a
    value
    of
    '1'
    (default
    setting)
    specifies
    that
    the
    data
    pin
    transition
    needs
    to
    be
    aligned
    before
    the
    last
    clock
    transition
    where
    delay
    measurement
    is
    intended.
    This
    value
    can
    be
    used
    in
    case
    of
    regular
    flip-flops.
    
    The
    value
    '2'
    specifies
    that
    data
    pin
    transition
    needs
    to
    be
    aligned
    with
    respect
    to
    the
    second-last
    triggering
    clock
    edge.
    This
    value
    can
    be
    used
    for
    cascaded
    2-bit
    flip
    flops.
    
    Additionally
    for
    sequential
    arcs,
    the
    first
    pin
    in
    the
    user-specified
    input

    You
    will
    need
    to

    window
    specifying
    the

    Tree
    Debugger
    window
    with
    a

    For
    example,
    if
    you

    as
    the
    window
    title,
    when
    session

    and
    the

    then
    the
    total

    if
    not
    specified
    using
    the
    -id
    parameter,

    "\fB-unit_delay\fR"
    Opens
    the
    CTD
    in
    the
    unit
    delay
    mode.
    The
    unit
    delay
    lets
    you
    view
    the
    depth
    of
    clock
    tree
    objects
    easily.
    This
    is
    useful
    when
    you
    have
    large
    designs
    with
    deep
    gate-level
    trees.
    When
    debugging
    clock
    trees,
    you
    can
    use
    this
    view
    to
    check
    how
    the
    clock
    trees
    are
    balanced
    by
    looking
    at
    the
    depth
    of
    the
    clock
    trees.
    Although,
    the
    unit
    delay
    mode
    can
    also
    be
    enabled
    using
    the
    Unit
    delay
    submenu
    in
    the
    Visibility
    menu
    of
    the
    CTD
    but
    this
    is
    only
    valid
    after
    running
    clock
    tree
    synthesis,
    and
    you
    still
    need
    to
    invoke
    timing
    calculation
    and
    extraction,
    which
    are
    time
    consuming.
    You
    can
    use
    this
    parameter
    to
    open
    the
    CTD
    in
    unit
    delay
    mode
    even
    if
    the
    design
    is
    not
    placed
    or
    without
    performing
    CTS.
    
    When

    Specifies
    the
    active

    Distributed

    You
    can

    running
    a
    single

    interactively.

    } }
    -script

    will
    group
    setup1
    to
    setup4
    views
    to
    Tempus
    client1
    will
    group

    client2
    irrespective

    To
    get
    optimum
    runtime
    while

    it
    is
    recommended

    model
    equivalent
    of

    The
    model
    is
    extracted
    for
    the
    given
    analysis
    modes,
    PVT
    conditions,
    and
    parasitics.
    If
    any
    one
    of
    these
    parameters
    change,
    then
    you
    must
    extract
    the
    model
    again.
    The
    model
    is
    extracted
    for
    a
    range
    of
    input
    slews
    and
    load

    specify
    these
    ranges,
    the
    software
    automatically
    computes
    the
    default
    values.
    The
    extracted
    model
    defines
    all
    of
    the
    top-level
    ports
    of
    the
    design
    as
    pins.

    design
    pins
    that
    are
    targets
    of
    create_clock
    or

    pins.
    .P
    For
    model
    extraction,
    your
    design
    must
    be
    properly
    constrained.
    For
    example,
    no

    is
    removed.
    This
    option
    reduces
    the
    extracted
    model
    size
    in
    scenarios
    where
    removing
    a
    pin
    can
    result
    in
    increased
    model
    size.
    The
    gain
    at
    an
    internal
    pin
    can
    be
    defined
    as:
    
    (number
    of
    incoming
    delay
    arcs
    *
    number
    of
    outgoing
    delay
    arcs)
    -
    (number
    of
    incoming
    delay
    arcs
    +
    number
    of
    outgoing
    delay
    arcs
    
    If
    an
    internal
    pin
    has
    a
    gain
    greater
    than
    the
    specified
    number,
    then
    that
    pin
    needs
    to
    be
    preserved
    in
    order
    to
    reduce
    the
    extracted
    model
    size.

    of
    1
    or
    2
    improves
    runtime
    and
    memory
    usage
    but
    may
    significantly
    degrade
    model
    accuracy.
    Use

    Note:
    The
    -leaf
    parameter
    can
    only
    be
    specified
    with
    the
    -of_objects
    parameter.
    
    "\fB-nocase\fR"
    Specifies
    that
    pattern
    matching
    is
    not

    Note:
    You
    must
    specify

    order
    to
    use
    this
    parameter.
    
    "\fB-of_objects

    with
    the
    specified
    pins,
    nets,
    library
    cells,
    or
    design
    cells.
    
    You
    can
    specify
    a

    cannot
    specify
    a

    or
    nets,
    or
    a
    combination
    of
    patterns
    and
    a
    collection.
    
    The
    -of_objects
    parameter
    supports
    get_designs
    and
    get_lib_cells
    as
    valid
    collection
    objects.
    
    The
    use

    [get_designs <object_list>]
    
    get_cells
    -of_objects
    [get_lib_cells <object_list>]
    
    "\fB<patterns>\fR"
    Specifies

    Patterns
    include
    the
    *
    and
    ?
    wildcard
    characters
    and
    collections
    of
    instances.
    
    The
    get_cells
    command
    returns
    a
    collection
    of
    instances
    that
    match
    the
    patterns.
    If
    no
    such
    instance
    is
    found,
    an
    empty
    collection
    is
    returned.
    
    "\fB-quiet\fR"
    Suppresses
    all
    error
    and
    warning
    messages
    generated
    when
    the
    get_cells
    command
    is
    run.
    
    "\fB-regexp\fR"
    Treats
    the
    specified
    patterns
    as
    a
    regular
    expression
    patterns.
    
    When
    this
    parameter
    is
    specified,
    the
    given
    patterns
    start
    and
    end
    are
    assumed
    to

    the
    start
    and
    end
    part
    of
    the
    complete
    object
    name.
    
    For
    example,
    the
    following
    can
    be
    used
    to
    retrieve
    the
    hierarchical

    Top/block1/block2/FF1:
    
    get_cells
    Top/*/*/FF1
    
    get_cells
    -regexp
    Top/.*/FF1
    
    However,
    the
    following
    command
    will
    display
    an
    error
    :
    
    get_cells
    Top/*/FF1
    
    If
    this
    parameter
    is
    specified
    with
    -hier
    parameter,
    the
    given
    pattern
    will
    be
    matched
    with
    the

    hierarchical
    name
    of

    instead
    of
    only
    the

    and
    all
    the
    successful
    matches
    are
    included
    in
    the

    For

    if
    there
    is
    a

    hierarchical
    instance
    Top
    and
    it

    then
    either
    of
    these

    Returns a value of max if the path is for setup, or min if

    Returns the time duration between the launching clock edge
    and capturing clock edge of the path.  The launching clock
    edge indicates the launching clock time when the signal at
    the start point of the path is launched, and the capturing
    clock edge indicates the capturing clock time when the signal
    at the path end point is captured. For both of these edges,
    their ideal clock cycle times are considered for calculating
    the path period.  For those paths, where either the launching
    or capturing clock is absent or asynchronous, the property
    prints NA. The property works for both setup (late) paths,
    and hold (early) paths.  Usually the path period is decided
    by a simple subtraction of effective launching edge from
    the effective capturing edge of the path. Under certain scenario,
    these edges are moved back or ahead in time, and accordingly
    the path period is also affected.  The following factors
    impact period:   a) Multicycle paths: The launch or capture
    edge will move by the cycle factor depending on the type
    of multi cycle exception, and this cycle factor is taken
    into account while computing the period.   b) Max delay paths:
    Any max_delay specification overrides the relationship between
    capturing and launching edges and sets it to the max_delay
    value. The period of the path is thus returned as equal to
    the specified max delay value for sequential max delay paths.
    Note that a combinational max delay path has at least one
    of the launch or capture clocks either absent or asynchronous,
    and hence the effective period is not calculated for them.
      c) Clock uncertainty: The uncertainties applicable to the
    interaction of launch and capture clocks for this particular
    path also affect the effective edges, but this factor is
    not taken into consideration while computing the period.
      d) Unconstrained paths: The unconstrained paths have no
    capture clock and hence period can not be calculated for
    them. The property will return NA.  Return value: float

    status descriptions are given below: .RS  "*" 2 SY: Synchronous
     "*" 2 INF: Attacker with infinite timing window  "*" 2 PE:
    Filtered due to physical exclusion  "*" 2 UF: Filtered by
    user  "*" 2 CN: Filtered because it is a constant net  "*"

    User-Defined Properties .P The user-defined properties allow
    you to define certain properties which can be interpreted
    by the software in a predefined way. When these properties
    are not specified, the software will revert to the default

    defined
    in
    the
    first
    .lib

    specify
    the
    $worst_power_window_start
    variable
    with
    the
    -start
    parameter
    to
    take
    the
    worst
    case
    start
    time

    Not
    required
    for
    TCF

    Note:
    You
    can
    read
    multiple
    windows
    in
    a
    single
    VCD
    file
    by
    specifying
    multiple
    pairs
    of
    the
    start
    time
    and
    end
    time
    for
    the
    non-overlapping
    multiple
    windows
    specified
    in
    the
    activity
    file.
    The
    use
    model
    for
    reading
    multiple
    windows
    is:
    
    read_activity_file
    -format

    design.vcd
    -start
    {<start1> <start2> <start3>}
    -end
    {<end1> <end2> <end3>}
    
    The
    <start1/2/3>
    and
    <end1/2/3>
    values
    should
    be
    in
    the
    ascending
    order.
    
    Multiple
    current
    waveforms
    representing
    multiple
    VCD
    windows
    are
    merged
    into
    a
    single
    continuous
    current
    waveform.
    To
    capture
    the
    waveform
    for
    signals
    at
    the
    edge
    of
    user
    windows,
    a
    buffer
    time
    is
    added
    between
    the
    windows
    being
    stitched
    using
    the
    set_power_analysis_mode
    -settling_buffer
    parameter.
    This
    buffer
    time
    ensures
    that
    the
    stitched
    waveform
    is
    contiguous.
    The
    generated
    waveform
    hence
    has
    the
    duration
    of
    user
    windows
    and
    the
    intervening
    settling
    buffers.
    The
    default
    settling
    buffer
    period
    is
    400ps.
    
    "\fB-start_time_shift

    to
    shift
    the
    start
    time
    of

    When
    you
    specify
    the
    -scale_duration
    parameter
    with
    the
    -start_time_shift
    parameter,
    it
    scales
    the
    start
    time
    shift
    along
    with
    the
    start/end
    time.
    
    "\fBname\fR"
    The
    name
    of
    the
    activity
    file.
    
    "\fB-weight
    <value>\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    weight
    number
    of
    the
    TCF
    file.
    1.0
    is
    the
    default
    value.
    The
    value
    should
    be
    a
    floating
    number
    that
    is
    smaller
    than
    
    1.0.
    This
    parameter
    allows
    you
    to
    merge
    multiple
    TCF
    files
    at
    different
    function
    modes
    for
    static

    weight
    of

    Delay Format (SDF) file and annotates user-specified delay
    information from the SDF file into the timing system. You
    can use the read_sdf command to supply pre-calculated delays
    and timing check values from an external delay calculator,
    or from a previous Tempus session. .P The read_sdf command
    can read version 2.1 and 3.0 of the SDF files, and can read
    both plain-text and GNU zipped (.gz) format files. The command
    and the Tempus software do not support the Timing Environment
    section of the SDF specification. .P The SDF file can provide
    one, two, or three different values for each timing arc delay
    or timing check value. These values are passed in the min,
    typ, or max SDF delay fields, represented as min:typ:max.
    .P The Tempus software provides multiple delay place holders
    to store the calculated or annotated delay information: .RS
     "*" 2 In single-corner (set_analysis_mode-analysisType single)
    analysis mode, only max delays are available. .RE .RS  "*"
    2 In best-case worst-case (set_analysis_mode -analysisType
    bcwc) mode, a min delay slot is provided for storing min
    delays used for hold analysis. A max delay slot stores delays
    used for setup analysis. .RE .RS  "*" 2 In on-chip variation
    (set_analysis_mode -analysisType onChipVariation) mode, the
    early delay slots stores delays used for calculated early
    arrival times. The late delay slot stores delays used for
    calculated late arrival times. .RE .RS  "*" 2 In multi-corner
    mode, an early and a late delay slot are provided for each
    multi-mode multi-corner analysis view. .RE .P The read_sdf
    command provides parameters for controlling how the SDF min:typ:max
    triplet values are mapped into the Tempus software's delay
    slots. The correct mapping depends on how the delay information
    in the SDF file was created, and what type of analysis you
    are performing. .P (<Image> To view the image, refer to the
    Tempus Text Command Reference - Release 20.2 manual.) .P
    The timing system provides special handling for annotating
    incremental delays. These delays typically represent plus
    or minus offsets due to crosstalk effects. Incremental delay
    annotation to the Tempus software can be done by: .RS  "*"
    2 Importing an incremental SDF file (SDF has an internal
    INCREMENT keyword) using the read_sdf command. .RE .RS  "*"
    2 Tcl sourcing a file of set_annotated_delay -net -delta_only
    constraints. .RE .P The incremental delay annotations can
    be viewed in the report_timing report by adding the incr_delay
    option to the report_timing -format list, or to the report_timing_format
    global variable.  .SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints
    out the command usage.   "\fB-continue_on_error\fR" Continues
    to read the file if an error occurs. By default, when an
    error occurs, the read_sdf command stops reading the file.
    Use this parameter to attempt to continue reading the file,
    if possible.  Note: Use caution if you continue, because
    some annotations could be missing due to the errors. Use
    the report_annotated_parasitics command to find missing annotations.
    If the file is corrupted, obtain a new SDF file.  "\fB-early_sdf_field
    {min | typ | max} \fR" Annotates the early delay from the
    specified SDF field.  In single-corner mode, all setup and
    hold analysis uses max delays. The software ignores any min/early
    delay information.  In best-case worst-case mode, use this
    parameter to specify which SDF field to use for hold analysis.
     In on-chip variation mode, the software uses the early delay
    for calculation of fast paths.  "\fB-ilm_filter\fR" Ignores
    ILM-related errors. By default, the read_sdf command does
    not ignore errors reported due to missing arcs in core ILM.
     "\fB-increment\fR" Increments the total delay without affecting
    the delta delay.  By default, when the SDF file contains
    the INCREMENT delay type, the read_sdf command will perform
    an adjustment on the delta delay slot which models SI cross-talk
    push-out/pull-in effects. When this option is used, the INCREMENT
    delays will be applied against the static base delay values
    instead.  "\fB-late_sdf_field {min | typ | max}\fR" Annotates
    the late delay from the specified SDF field.  In single-corner
    mode, use this parameter to specify which of the SDF triplet
    values to annotate for both setup and hold checks.  In best-case
    worst-case mode, use this parameter to specify which SDF
    field to use for setup analysis.  In on-chip variation mode,
    the software uses the late delay for the calculation of slow
    paths.  "\fB-overwrite_incremental_delay\fR" When annotating
    an incremental SDF file, replaces any pre-existing delta
    delays with the new SDF values. The total delay will be equivalent
    to the original base delay, plus the new delta delay.  If
    the delays in the incremental SDF file represent crosstalk
    delay push-outs from a signal integrity analysis, use the
    -overwrite_incremental_delay parameter to ensure that any
    stale data from a previous analysis is removed.  By default,
    when an incremental SDF file (SDF has an internal INCREMENT
    keyword) is annotated, the delays are added to the base delay,
    and also stored separately as delta delays. If an additional
    incremental SDF file is annotated, the software adds the
    existing base and delta delays with the new values.  "\fB-path
    <instanceName>\fR" Specifies the instance in the design to
    which the specified SDF file should be applied.  "\fB-persistent
    \fR" Keeps the delays from certain SDF files persistently
    in use during various steps of the timing optimization .
    Use this parameter to support pre-timed structures, such
    as clock meshes.  "\fB-print_summary\fR" Outputs the summary
    information of annotated delays.  "\fB-scale <float>\fR"
    Overrides the automatic scaling of SDF delays to the library
    units by the value given. To disable all scaling, use a value
    of 1.0.  "\fB-sdf_field {min | typ | max}\fR" Annotates the
    delay from the specified SDF slot.  In single-corner and
    best-case worst-case modes, the software uses this value
    for both setup and hold analysis.  In on-chip variation mode,
    the software uses the same value from the specified SDF slot
    for both the early and late delays of the specified arc.
     "\fB<sdf_filename>\fR" Specifies the name of the SDF file
    that has the back annotation data.  "\fB-strict_cond_matching\fR"
    Annotates only the conditions that are an exact syntax-to-syntax
    match between the SDF file and the .lib file.  Default: Uses
    looser conditional matching rules between the .lib and SDF
    arc specifications.  "\fB-view <viewName>\fR" Annotates the
    specified analysis view(s) with the delays from the SDF file.
    You can use this parameter only when you are in multi-mode
    multi-corner analysis mode.  .SH Examples .P Here are some
    examples. .RS  "*" 2 The following command annotates delay
    information from the SDF min field in to the min/early slots,

    triplet
    values
    in
    the
    SPEF
    file
    is
    to
    be
    loaded.
    
    The
    -spef_field
    parameter
    specifies
    the
    list
    of
    RC
    corner
    indices
    {1 2 3....N}
    in
    the
    SPEF
    file
    to
    be
    loaded
    instead
    of
    triplet
    values.
    This
    parameter
    provides
    the
    flexibility
    to
    perform
    order-independent
    and
    field-independent
    mapping
    to
    RC
    corners.
    
    "\fBfileName
    <fileName>\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    SPEF
    file.
    You
    can
    specify
    multiple
    files
    in
    a
    single
    command.
    
    "\fB-rc_corner
    <rcCornerName(s)>\fR"
    Annotates
    the
    parasitics
    to
    the
    predefined
    RC
    corner
    for
    multi-corner
    analysis.
    If
    you
    want
    to
    use
    SPEF
    information
    when
    calculating
    delays
    in

    you
    must
    annotate
    the
    parasitics
    for
    each
    RC
    corner
    in
    the
    design.
    
    For
    example,
    if
    you
    have
    four
    active
    RC
    corners
    in
    the

    you
    must

    When

    writes
    the
    report
    to
    the
    specified
    file
    name.
    If
    the
    file
    already
    exists,
    the
    software
    overwrites
    it.
    
    When
    specified
    with
    >>,
    writes
    the
    report
    to
    the
    specified
    file
    name.
    If
    the
    file
    already
    exists,
    the
    software
    concatenates
    the
    report
    to
    the
    end
    of
    the
    file.
    
    The
    <filename>
    parameter
    must
    be
    the
    last
    argument
    in
    the
    list.
    The
    <filename>
    and
    -tcl_list
    parameters
    are
    mutually
    exclusive;
    you
    cannot

    Note:
    To

    "\fB-tcl_list\fR"
    Produces
    the
    report
    in
    Tcl
    list
    format
    instead
    of
    a
    tabular
    format.
    This
    is
    useful
    for
    integrating
    timing
    with
    custom
    Tcl
    functions,
    and
    also
    for
    customizing
    report
    generation.
    
    The
    -tcl_list
    and
    <filename>
    parameters
    are
    mutually
    exclusive;
    you
    cannot

    usage.
    
    
    "\fB{> | >>}
    <filename>\fR"
    When
    specified
    with
    >,
    writes
    the
    report
    to
    the
    specified
    file
    name.
    If
    the
    file
    already
    exists,
    the
    software
    overwrites
    it.
    
    When
    specified
    with
    >>,
    writes
    the
    report
    to
    the
    specified
    file
    name.
    If
    the
    file
    already
    exists,
    the
    software
    concatenates
    the
    report
    to
    the
    end
    of
    the
    file.
    
    The
    <filename>parameter
    must
    be
    the
    last
    argument
    in
    the
    list.
    The
    <filename>
    and
    -tcl_list
    parameters
    are
    mutually
    exclusive;
    you
    cannot
    specify
    them
    together.
    
    Note:
    To
    write
    a
    compressed
    report,
    add
    the
    .gz
    extension
    to
    the
    file
    name.
    
    Default:
    Report
    is
    displayed
    on
    standard
    output
    without
    being
    saved.
    
    "\fB-all\fR"
    Specifies
    that
    the
    Logic
    Constant
    Value
    table
    report
    pins
    or
    ports
    with
    set_logic
    constants,
    constants
    in
    the
    netlist,
    and
    output
    pins
    with
    a
    constant
    function.
    These
    output
    pins
    are
    from
    library
    cells
    or
    netlist
    modules.
    
    "\fB-nosplit\fR"
    Specifies
    that
    reports
    with
    long
    names
    will
    not
    be
    split
    into
    multiple
    lines.
    
    Note:
    The
    -nosplit
    parameter
    works
    if
    set_table_style
    
    -no_frame_fix_width
    command
    is
    specified.
    
    "\fB-dir\fR"
    Specifies
    that
    the
    report
    include
    the
    direction
    of
    the
    pin
    or
    port,
    which
    is
    reported
    as
    input,
    output,
    or
    inout
    (internal
    pins
    may
    not
    have
    constant
    constraints).
    
    "\fB<pins_and_ports_list>
    
    \fR"
    Generates
    a
    report
    only
    for
    the
    pins
    and
    ports
    in
    the
    specified
    list.
    
    Default:
    Generates
    a
    report
    for
    all
    pins
    and
    ports
    in
    the
    design.
    
    "\fB-tcl_list\fR"
    Produces
    the
    report
    in
    Tcl
    list
    format
    instead
    of
    a
    tabular
    format.
    This
    is
    useful
    for
    integrating
    timing
    with
    custom
    Tcl
    functions,
    and
    also
    for
    customizing
    report
    generation.
    
    The
    -tcl_list
    and
    <filename>parameters

    writes
    the

    to
    the
    specified
    file
    name.
    If
    the
    file
    already
    exists,
    the

    overwrites
    it.
    
    When

    writes
    the

    concatenates
    the

    Note:
    To

    Default:
    Report

    "\fB-clock_timing\fR"
    Specifies
    that
    slack

    for
    clock
    style
    checks.

    hold/clock
    setup)
    or
    late
    (minimum)
    path
    (data
    setup/clock
    hold).
    
    You
    must
    use
    the
    set_analysis_mode
    -checkType
    hold
    command
    and
    run
    the
    report_timing
    command
    before
    using
    the
    -early
    parameter.
    Similarly,
    you
    must
    use
    the
    set_analysis_mode-checkType
    setup
    command
    and
    run
    the
    report_timing
    command
    before
    using
    the
    -late
    parameter.
    
    Default:
    If
    you
    do
    not
    specify
    any
    of
    the
    parameters,
    the
    software
    uses
    the
    -late
    parameter.
    
    "\fB<list_of_cell_instances>\fR"
    Specifies
    a
    flat
    (non-hierarchical)
    cell
    instance
    or
    list
    of
    cell
    instances.
    Use
    curly
    braces
    ({})
    to
    enclose
    the
    list
    and
    separate
    the
    instance
    names
    with
    white
    space.
    
    "\fB-tcl_list\fR"
    Produces
    the
    report
    in
    Tcl
    list
    format
    instead
    of
    a
    tabular
    format.
    This
    is
    useful
    for
    integrating
    timing
    with
    custom
    Tcl
    functions,
    and
    also
    for
    customizing
    report
    generation.
    
    The
    -tcl_list

    <filename>]   .P Generates a clock skew report for the current
    design. The software generates a separate report for each
    specified clock or pair of clocks. You specify the clocks
    using the -clock parameter, and clock pairs using the -from_clock
    and -to_clock parameters. You can use the -nworst and -greater_than
    parameters with the -from_clock and -to_clock parameters
    to generate reports with skew to the specified sink pins.
    You can use the -early and -late parameters to specify the
    type of skew to be reported. .P Note: To remove common path
    pessimism from the reported skew, use the set_analysis_mode
    -cppr both command before using the report_clock_timing command.
    The report contains a separate column for common path adjustment
    values. .P You can use the report_clock_timing command to
    perform MMMC based SSTA analysis. In MMMC mode, the command
    reports the latency and clock skew for all individual views.
    You can use the report_clock_timing -view parameter to report
    clock timing for a user-specified view.  .SH Parameters 
      "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB{> |
    >>} <filename>\fR" When specified with >, writes the report
    to the specified file name. If the file already exists, the
    software overwrites it.  When specified with >>, writes the
    report to the specified file name. If the file already exists,
    the software concatenates the report to the end of the file.
     The <filename> parameter must be the last argument in the
    list. The <filename> and -tcl_list parameters are mutually
    exclusive; you cannot specify them together.  Note: To write
    a compressed report, add the .gz extension to the file name.
     Default: Report is displayed on standard output without
    being saved.  "\fB-absolute_compare\fR" Reports skews with
    values compared in absolute form.   "\fB-clock <clock_list>\fR"
    Specifies the list of clocks to be reported. The software
    generates a separate report for each clock that you specify
    in the <clock_list>.  Default: Skew report is generated for
    all clocks in the design.  "\fB-cppr_relative\fR" Reports
    the latency in skew reports from the CPPR common pin. When
    specified, the reports are printed with latency measured
    from branch point to the register's CK pin. The CPPR value
    is no longer required in reports.   "\fB-early\fR" Uses hold
    skew to generate the report. Hold skew is the difference
    between minimum latency at the start point flip-flop and
    the maximum latency at the end point flip-flop.  Default:
    Uses the setup skew.  "\fB-format <column_list>\fR" Specifies
    which columns to display for path reports, and the order
    in which they should appear.  For example:  -format {instance
    arc pin cell slew load}   The -format parameter can be used
    only for latency or skew reports (-type skew, -type interclock_skew,
    or -type latency), and if the -verbose parameter is specified.
     See report_timing for a list of valid arguments.  "\fB-from
    <from_list>\fR" Specifies the list of sequential device clock
    pins or ports to consider as from-pins in the generated report.
    If any pin in the <from_list> is not a sequential device
    clock pin, it is replaced with all the sequential device
    clock pins in the transitive fanout of the named pin. If
    there are no sequential pins in the transitive fanout of
    the pin, the software drops the pin from the list and generates
    a warning message.  "\fB  -from_clock <from_clock_list>\fR"
    Specifies the list of from-clocks to be used in generating
    the current interclock skew report. You can use this option
    only in an interclock skew report.  Default: Report is generated
    considering all clocks as from-clocks.  "\fB-greater_than
    <lower_limit>\fR" Reports skews with values greater than
    the <lower_limit> value.  "\fB-histogram\fR" Generates a
    textual histogram of the latency report.  The -histogram
    parameter can be used only when -type latency is specified.
    When specified in conjunction with the -clock parameter,
    the software limits the latency reporting to the specified
    clocks only. When specified with the -greater_than parameter,
    the software limits the latency reporting to clocks with
    a latency value that is greater than the specified value.
      Note: The -histogram parameter cannot be specified in conjunction
    with the following parameters: -launch,-capture, -from, -to,
    -from_clock, -to_clock, -verbose, -nworst.  "\fB-histogram_range
    <interval_size>\fR" Generates the histogram report at the
    specified intervals. The interval size specified must be
    a positive integer or decimal values.  For example, if the
    maximum latency value is 437, and you specify -histogram_range
    50, the histogram would be generated with intervals of: 0-50,
    50-100, 100-150, ... 400-450.  Note: The unit of <interval_size>
    will be the same as that used for generating the timing report.
     This parameter can be used only when the -histogram parameter
    is specified.  "\fB-late\fR" Uses setup skew to generate
    the report. Setup skew is the difference between the maximum
    latency at the start point flip-flop and minimum latency
    at the end point flip-flop.  "\fB-latency_greater_than\fR"
    Filters reports (used with the the -type parameter) on the
    basis of latency/depth greater than the specified value.
     With -type skew or interclock_skew option, the reports are
    filtered for latency greater than the given value  With -type
    cppr_stage_count option, the reports are filtered for depth
    greater than the given value.  "\fB-launch | -capture\fR"
    When specified with -type latency, generates a report of
    either the launch latency values (-launch), or the capture
    latency values (-capture).  Note: You can specify these parameters
    only with -type latency.  Default: -launch  "\fB-logic_level\fR"
    Reports the levels (the stage count of gates) between the
    clock root, or generated clock root, and the capturing register.
     The -logic_level parameter can be used only when -type latency
    is specified.  The -logic_level parameter cannot be specified
    in conjunction with the following parameters: -launch,-capture,
    -from, -to, -from_clock, -to_clock, -verbose, -nworst.  "\fB-nworst
    <worst_entries>\fR" Specifies the number of entries to be
    reported per clock domain.  Default: 1  "\fB-rise | -fall\fR"
    Specifies active transition at sequential devices clock pins.
     The -rise and -fall parameters are mutually exclusive and
    cannot be specified together.  Note: You can specify these
    parameters only with the -type latency parameter.  "\fB-source
    {clock_root | generated_clock}\fR" Reports the latency from
    either the master clock, or the generated clock that was
    derived from it.  The -source parameter can be used only
    when -logic_level is specified.  The -source parameter cannot
    be specified in conjunction with the following parameters:
    -launch,-capture, -from, -to, -from_clock, -to_clock, -verbose,
    -nworst.  Default: Reports the latency from the master clock
    (-source clock_root)  "\fB-tcl_list \fR" Produces the report
    in Tcl list format instead of a tabular format. This is useful
    for integrating timing with custom Tcl functions, and also
    for customizing report generation.  The -tcl_list and <filename>
    parameters are mutually exclusive; you cannot specify them
    together.  "\fB-to <to_list>\fR" Specifies the list or collection
    of sequential device clock pins or ports to be considered
    for reporting. If any pin in the <to_list> is not a sequential
    device clock pin, it is replaced with all the sequential
    device clock pins in the transitive fanout of the named pin.
    If there are no sequential pins in the transitive fanout
    of the pin, the software drops the pin from the list and
    generates a warning message.  "\fB-to_clock <to_clock_list>\fR"
    Specifies the list of to-clocks to be used in generating
    the current interclock skew report. You can use this option
    only in an interclock skew report.  Default: Report is generated
    considering all clocks as to-clocks.  "\fB-type {skew | interclock_skew
    | jitter summary | latency | cppr_stage_count} \fR" Specifies
    the type of report to generate. The -type options are described
    below. .RS  "*" 2 skew: Reports the skew for all clocks,
    or for clocks that you specify using the -clock parameter.
      "*" 2 interclock_skew: Reports the skew between all clocks
    in the design, or between clocks that you specify using the
    -from_clock and -to_clock parameters.  "*" 2 jitter: Reports
    the difference in late and early arrival times of a clock
    phase at a clock end point. When specified, the software
    generates a clock jitter report for one clock end point,
    for each clock in the design.  You can generate a jitter
    report for all clocks, or clocks specified with the -clock
    parameter. You can limit the report to a specific clock end
    point using the -to parameter.  Note: The report_clock_timing-typejitter
    option can be used only when the software is in On-Chip Variation
    (OCV) timing analysis mode. Jitter analysis does not remove
    any common path pessimism. .RE .RS  "*" 2 summary:Generates

    The reports are generated on the basis of logical CPPR points

    picked. For example,  Branch Point  Difference  Depth  Clock

    Generates a report that contains the full clock path from
    the clock source to the sink pin (the clock pin of the flop
    or latch).  You can specify the -verbose parameter only for
    skew or latency reports (-type skew, -type interclock_skew,
    or -type latency).  When this parameter is specified in SOCV
    mode, the intermediate arrival times of pins are shown as
    "-" in the report output.  "\fB-view <view_name>\fR" Generates
    a report for the specified analysis view only. You can specify
    this parameter only when the software is in multi-mode multi-corner
    timing analysis mode.  .SH Examples .RS  "*" 2 The following

    usage.
    
    
    "\fB{> | >>}
    <filename>\fR"
    When
    specified
    with
    >,
    writes
    the
    report
    to
    the
    specified
    file
    name.
    If
    the
    file
    already
    exists,
    the
    software
    overwrites
    it.
    
    When
    specified
    with
    >>,
    writes
    the
    report
    to
    the
    specified
    file
    name.
    If
    the
    file
    already
    exists,
    the
    software
    concatenates
    the
    report
    to
    the
    end
    of
    the
    file.
    
    The
    <filename>
    parameter
    must
    be
    the
    last
    argument
    in
    the
    list.
    The
    <filename>
    and
    -tcl_list
    parameters
    are
    mutually
    exclusive;
    you
    cannot
    specify
    them
    together.
    
    Note:
    To
    write
    a
    compressed
    report,
    add
    the
    .gz
    extension
    to
    the
    file
    name.
    
    Default:
    Report
    is
    displayed
    on
    standard
    output
    without
    being
    saved.
    
    "\fB-adjustment_table\fR"
    Reports
    two
    tables
    that
    detail
    the
    hold
    and
    setup
    cycle
    adjustments
    between
    clock
    waveforms
    as
    set
    by
    the
    set_multicycle_path
    command.
    
    Note:
    If
    specific
    ideal
    (or
    generated)
    clocks
    are
    requested
    with
    the
    -clocks
    <clock_name_list>
    option,
    then
    only
    the
    relationships
    between
    those
    clock
    signals
    are
    reported.
    
    "\fB-arrival_points\fR"
    Reports
    only
    the
    clock
    arrival
    points.
    A
    clock
    arrival
    point
    is
    the
    pin
    where
    the
    create_clockor
    create_generated_clock
    command
    has
    been
    asserted.
    
    Note:
    This
    parameter
    is
    obsolete
    and
    will
    be
    removed
    in
    a
    future
    release.
    
    "\fB-clocks
    <clk_signame>
    |
    <clk_signame_list>\fR"
    Requests
    information
    on
    a
    specific
    ideal
    (or
    generated)
    clock.
    If
    a
    list
    is
    given,
    only
    information
    about
    those
    clocks
    is
    reported.
    You
    can
    use
    wildcards
    in
    the
    names.
    
    
    Default:
    All
    clocks,
    except
    generated
    clocks,
    are
    reported.
    Use
    the
    -generated
    option
    to
    report
    generated
    clocks.
    
    Note:
    This
    parameter
    is
    obsolete
    and
    will
    be
    removed
    in
    a
    future
    release.
    Cadence
    recommends
    that
    you
    specify
    clock
    names
    without
    the
    -clocks
    parameter.
    
    "\fB-clock_source_jitter\fR"
    Reports
    the
    clock
    source
    jitter
    applied
    to
    specific
    clocks.
    
    When
    this
    parameter
    is
    specified,
    the
    report
    output
    shows
    the
    clock
    and
    master
    clock
    columns
    to
    indicate
    the
    inheritance
    of
    source
    clock
    jitter
    from
    a
    master
    clock
    (defined
    using
    the
    create_clock
    command)
    to
    a
    generated
    clock.
    
    "\fB-delay_adjustment_table\fR"
    Reports
    two
    tables
    that
    detail
    the
    early
    and
    late
    path
    delay
    adjustments
    between
    clock
    waveforms
    as
    set
    by
    the
    set_max_delay
    and
    set_min_delay
    commands.
    
    Note:
    If
    specific
    ideal
    (or
    generated)
    clocks
    are
    requested
    with
    the
    -clocks
    <clock_name_list>
    option,
    then
    only
    the
    relationships
    between
    those
    clock
    signals
    are
    reported.
    
    "\fB-description\fR"
    Reports
    only
    the
    description
    of
    the
    specified
    clock
    waveform(s).
    
    "\fB-generated\fR"
    Includes
    information
    on
    generated
    clocks
    in
    the
    report,
    such
    as
    source
    and
    master
    clock
    of
    the
    generated
    clock,
    and
    other
    information
    specified
    in
    the
    create_generated_clock
    constraints.
    The
    report
    uses
    the
    internal
    clock
    names
    created
    by
    the
    system,
    if
    you
    did
    not
    specify
    new
    clock
    names
    while
    creating
    these
    clocks.
    
    Note:
    This
    parameter
    is
    obsolete
    and
    will
    be
    removed
    in
    a
    future
    release.
    The
    software
    now
    reports
    generated
    clocks
    by
    default.
    
    "\fB-groups\fR"
    Reports
    the
    existing
    clock
    groups.
    
    "\fB-hierarchy\fR"
    Reports
    the
    inter-clock
    relationship
    in
    tree
    style
    format.
    
    
    "\fB-insertion\fR"
    Reports
    the
    network
    insertion
    delays
    specified
    on
    clock
    waveforms.
    The
    values
    in
    the
    table
    are
    in
    min:typ:max
    format.
    
    "\fB-phase_shift_table\fR"
    Reports
    the
    table
    that
    details
    the
    phase
    shift
    between
    clock
    waveforms.
    Based
    upon
    the
    current
    analysis
    mode,
    the
    table
    shows
    the
    phase
    shifts
    either
    in
    late
    or
    early
    mode.
    In
    case
    of
    simultaneous
    setup
    hold
    mode,
    both
    the
    tables
    are
    reported
    for
    phase
    shift
    in
    late
    and
    early
    mode.
    
    Note:
    If
    specific
    ideal
    (or
    generated)
    clocks
    are
    requested
    with
    the
    -clocks
    <clock_name_list>
    option,
    then
    only
    the
    relationships
    between
    those
    clock
    signals
    are
    reported.
    
    "\fB-source_insertion\fR"
    Reports
    the
    source
    insertion
    delays
    specified
    on
    clock
    waveforms.
    
    "\fB-tcl_list\fR"
    Produces
    the
    report
    in
    Tcl
    list
    format
    instead
    of
    a
    tabular
    format.
    This
    is
    useful
    for
    integrating
    timing
    with
    custom
    Tcl
    functions,
    and
    also
    for
    customizing
    report
    generation.
    
    The
    -tcl_list
    and
    <filename>
    parameters
    are
    mutually
    exclusive;
    you
    cannot
    specify
    them
    together.
    
    "\fB-total_shift_table\fR"
    Based
    on
    the
    current
    analysis
    mode,
    reports
    one
    of
    the
    tables
    (late
    or
    early
    mode)
    that
    details
    the
    total
    relationship
    between
    clock
    waveforms.
    In
    case
    of
    simultaneous
    setup
    hold
    mode
    both
    the
    tables
    are
    reported.
    
    Note:
    If
    specific
    ideal
    (or
    generated)
    clocks
    are
    requested
    with
    the
    -clocks
    <clock_name_list>
    option,
    then
    only
    the
    relationships
    between
    those
    clock
    signals
    are
    reported.
    
    "\fB-uncertainty_table\fR"
    Based
    on
    the
    current
    analysis
    mode,
    reports
    one
    of
    the
    tables
    (late
    mode
    or
    early
    mode)
    that
    detail
    the
    uncertainty
    between
    clock
    waveforms
    as
    specified
    using
    the
    set_clock_uncertainty
    command.
    In
    case
    of
    simultaneous
    setup
    hold
    mode
    both
    the
    tables
    are
    reported.
    The
    tables
    report
    only
    those
    clock
    waveforms
    for
    which
    uncertainty
    has
    been
    defined
    using
    the
    set_clock_uncertainty
    command.
    
    Note:
    If
    specific
    ideal
    (or
    generated)
    clocks
    are
    requested
    with
    the
    -clocks
    <clock_name_list>
    option,
    then
    only
    the
    relationships
    between
    those
    clock
    signals
    are
    reported.
    
    "\fB-view
    <view_name>\fR"
    Generates
    a
    clock

    those
    with
    slack
    worse
    than
    the

    based
    on
    the
    specified
    cost.
    
    Default:

    in
    bcwc
    or
    onChipVariation
    analysis
    mode.
    
    The

    list
    format
    instead
    of
    a
    tabular
    format.
    This
    is
    useful
    for
    integrating
    timing
    with
    custom
    Tcl
    functions,
    and
    also
    for

    Note:

    .P
    Double
    clocking
    occurs
    when

    glitch
    attacks
    a

    signal.
    The

    the
    transition
    time
    check
    performed
    in
    static
    timing
    analysis.
    Transition
    time
    is
    defined
    as
    the
    duration
    of
    time
    that
    a
    signal
    takes
    to
    make
    the
    transition
    between
    two
    threshold
    points.
    However,
    transition
    time
    does
    not
    account
    for
    the
    waveform
    shape
    between
    the
    voltage
    thresholds.
    .P
    For
    special
    signals
    such
    as
    clocks
    it
    is
    important
    to
    analyze
    the
    waveform
    shape
    between
    the
    voltage
    threshold
    in
    case
    the
    signal
    transitions
    slowly
    or
    in
    the
    opposite
    direction

    for
    a
    short
    duration
    of
    time)
    causing
    multiple

    edges.
    This

    enables
    you
    to
    report
    the
    worst-case
    slope
    (dV/dtfor
    rising
    signal
    and
    -dV/dt
    for
    falling
    signal)
    of
    a
    signal
    transitioning
    between
    the
    voltage
    thresholds.
    The
    slope
    derivative
    is
    measured
    in
    units
    of
    volts
    per
    nanosecond
    (V/ns).
    This
    value
    can
    be
    positive
    if
    the
    signal
    does
    not
    change
    direction,
    0
    if
    the
    signal
    is
    flat,

    When
    specified
    with
    >,
    writes
    the
    report
    to
    the
    specified
    file
    name.
    If
    the
    file
    already
    exists,
    the
    software
    overwrites
    it.
    
    When
    specified
    with
    >>,
    writes
    the
    report
    to
    the
    specified
    file
    name.
    If
    the
    file
    already
    exists,
    the
    software
    concatenates
    the
    report
    to
    the
    end
    of
    the
    file.
    
    The
    <filename>
    parameter
    must
    be
    the
    last
    argument
    in
    the
    list.
    The
    <filename>
    and
    -tcl_list
    parameters
    are
    mutually
    exclusive;
    you
    cannot
    specify
    them
    together.
    
    Note:
    To
    write
    a
    compressed
    report,
    add
    the
    .gz
    extension
    to
    the
    file
    name.
    
    Default:
    Report
    is
    displayed
    on
    standard
    output
    without
    being
    saved.
    
    "\fB-net\fR"
    Adds
    a

    for
    the
    net
    arc.
    
    
    "\fB-path_type
    {summary | short | full_clock}\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    type
    of
    report
    to
    generate.
    
    Default:
    summary
    summary:
    Generates
    a
    summary
    report
    for
    each
    pulse
    width
    check
    that
    shows
    the
    required
    width,
    the
    actual
    width,
    and
    the
    resulting
    slack.
    short:
    Generates
    a
    path
    report
    for
    each
    pulse
    width
    check
    that
    lists
    the
    latency
    of
    each
    edge
    of
    the
    pulse
    as
    a
    single
    lumped
    value,
    instead
    of
    reporting
    a
    detailed
    path
    report.
    full_clock:
    Generates
    a
    path
    report
    for
    each
    pulse
    width
    check
    that
    shows
    the
    detailed
    pin-to-pin
    path
    for
    each
    edge
    of
    the
    pulse.
    
    Note:
    The
    -path_type
    full_clock
    parameter
    may
    cause
    an
    increased
    runtime.
    In
    that
    case
    you
    can
    use
    the
    -path_type
    short
    parameter.
    
    "\fB-pins
    <object_list>\fR"
    Specifies
    a
    set
    of
    ports
    and
    pins
    on
    the
    clock
    network.
    If
    this
    list
    is
    not
    specified,
    then
    the
    report
    contains
    all
    the
    pins
    and
    ports
    in
    the
    current
    design.
    
    "\fB-tcl_list
    \fR"
    Produces
    the
    report
    in
    Tcl
    list
    format
    instead
    of
    a
    tabular
    format.
    This
    is
    useful
    for
    integrating
    timing
    with
    custom
    Tcl
    functions,
    and
    also
    for
    customizing
    report
    generation.
    
    The
    -tcl_list
    and
    <filename>
    parameters
    are
    mutually
    exclusive;
    you
    cannot
    specify
    them
    together.
    
    "\fB-verbose
    \fR"
    Provides
    detailed
    information
    about
    minimum
    pulse
    width
    calculations.
    
    Note:
    This
    parameter
    is
    obsolete.
    The
    parameter
    still
    works
    in
    this
    release,
    but
    to
    ensure
    compatibility
    with
    future
    releases,
    use
    the
    -path_type
    parameter
    instead.
    
    "\fB-view
    <view_name>\fR"
    Generates
    the
    report
    for
    the
    specified
    analysis

    You
    can
    specify
    this
    parameter
    only
    when
    the

    is
    in
    multi-mode

    "\fB-violation_only\fR"
    Reports

    minimum

    width
    violations.
    
    "\fB-waveform_aware_type
    {regular | waveform_aware | both}\fR"
    Reports
    the

    pulse
    width

    You
    can
    specify
    the
    following

    Parameters

    Prints
    out
    the
    command
    usage.
    
    
    "\fB>
    <filename>\fR"
    Writes
    the
    report
    to
    the
    specified
    file
    name.
    If
    the
    file
    already
    exists,
    the
    software
    overwrites
    it.
    
    The
    <filename>
    parameter
    must
    be
    the
    last
    argument
    in
    the
    list.
    The
    <filename>
    and
    -tcl_list
    parameters
    are
    mutually
    exclusive;
    you
    cannot
    specify
    them
    together.
    
    Note:
    To
    write
    a
    compressed
    report,
    add
    the
    .gz
    extension
    to
    the
    file
    name.
    
    Default:
    Report
    is
    displayed
    on
    standard
    output
    without
    being
    saved.
    
    "\fB-include_pins\fR"
    Reports
    timing
    constraints
    on
    instance
    pins,
    as
    well
    as
    on
    ports.
    
    Default:
    Reports
    timing
    constraints
    on
    ports
    only.
    
    "\fB-pins
    <port_name_list>\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    pins
    or
    ports
    to
    be
    reported.
    Pins
    can
    be
    specified

    by
    object
    ID
    in
    a
    Tcl
    list.
    
    "\fB-tcl_list\fR"
    Produces
    the
    report
    in
    Tcl
    list
    format
    instead
    of
    a
    tabular
    format.
    This
    is
    useful
    for
    integrating
    timing
    with
    custom
    Tcl
    functions,
    and
    also
    for
    customizing
    report
    generation.
    
    The
    -tcl_list
    and

    The
    report_power
    command
    allows
    generation
    of
    multiple
    power
    reports
    with
    a
    single
    report_power
    command.
    This
    allows
    you
    to
    generate
    all
    the
    static
    reports
    during
    dynamic
    analysis,
    and
    removes
    the
    need
    to
    run
    incremental
    report_power
    in
    static
    power
    analysis
    using
    a
    Verilog
    netlist.
    By
    default,
    a
    detailed
    power
    summary
    report,
    and
    a
    short
    summary
    will
    be
    printed
    at
    the
    beginning
    of
    all
    reports.
    To

    power
    map
    file
    in
    the
    simple
    or
    stack
    format
    to
    perform
    accurate
    thermal
    analysis.
    You
    must
    use
    the
    stack
    format
    to
    support
    multiple
    dies
    in

    analysis.
    
    
    "\fB-thermal_power_map_header_include_file
    <filename>\fR"
    Specifies
    a
    file
    that
    contains
    comments
    or
    additional
    information
    to
    be
    included
    in
    the
    header
    section
    of
    the
    power
    map
    file.
    
    
    "\fB-thermal_power_map_tile
    {<Xint> <Yint>}\fR"
    Defines
    the
    tile
    number
    in
    the
    X
    and
    Y
    direction.
    By
    default
    10*10
    will
    be
    used.
    
    
    "\fB-threshold
    <value>\fR"
    Filters
    out
    the
    instances
    whose
    total
    power
    dissipation
    is
    less
    than
    the
    specified
    value.
    Units
    are
    in
    milliwatts.
    
    Default:
    0
    
    "\fB-threshold_voltage_group
    { all | <group_name>}\fR"
    Reports
    leakage
    by
    voltage
    threshold
    group
    in
    the
    power
    report.
    This
    parameter
    supports
    the
    argument
    all
    (default
    value)
    or
    any
    other
    string,
    such
    as
    hvt
    or
    lvt.
    
    Default:
    all
    
    "\fB-time_based_report\fR"
    Writes
    out
    a
    detailed
    VCD
    profiling
    report
    into
    the
    file
    that
    you
    specify.
    
    
    "\fB-time_unit
    <unit>\fR"
    Sets
    the
    time
    unit
    to
    be
    used
    for
    power
    report
    generation.
    The
    default
    unit
    is
    ns
    (nanoseconds).
    
    
    "\fB-toggle_rate\fR"
    Specifies
    to
    dump
    out
    instance-based
    activity
    to
    the
    outfile.
    The
    toggle
    rate
    for
    each
    instance
    is
    based
    on
    the
    clock
    frequency
    to
    which
    it
    belongs.
    If
    multiple
    clocks
    are
    reaching
    the
    instance,
    then
    the
    fastest
    clock
    is
    used
    as
    a
    reference.
    
    
    "\fB-view
    <view_name>\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    active
    timing
    view
    that
    was
    created
    using
    the
    multi-mode
    multi-corner
    (MMMC)
    set_analysis_view
    -setup|-hold
    command.
    Power
    analysis
    is
    performed
    for
    the
    specified
    view.
    The
    command
    prints
    the
    MMMC
    view
    name
    in
    the
    output
    file
    even
    if
    you
    do
    not
    specify
    the
    -view
    parameter.
    
    If
    report_power
    -view
    <view_name>
    is
    set,
    it
    will
    override
    the
    view
    set
    in
    the
    set_power_analysis_mode
    -view
    command.
    However,
    if
    you
    specify
    the
    set_analysis_view
    -dynamic
    and
    -leakage
    parameters,
    then
    the
    view
    set
    using
    these
    set_analysis_view
    command
    parameters
    has
    higher
    priority
    over
    the
    report_power
    -view
    command.
    
    Default:
    Uses
    current
    view
    in
    Tempus.

    limits
    the
    report
    to
    paths
    that
    fall
    into
    the
    specified
    range.
    A
    positive
    slack
    value
    indicates
    that
    timing
    was
    met.
    A
    negative
    value
    for

    indicates
    a

    cannot
    be
    used
    with
    the

    You
    can
    generate

    report
    showing
    paths
    with
    slack
    greater
    than
    the
    specified
    slack
    by
    using

    For
    example,
    to
    report
    all
    paths
    with
    slack
    greater
    than
    2ns,
    you
    can

    the
    following
    command:
    
    min_slack

    In
    this
    case
    the

    reported
    will
    be
    1000.
    
    When
    the
    -min_slack
    parameter
    is
    specified,
    the
    total
    numbers
    of

    processed
    will
    be
    as

    and
    only
    those
    paths
    satisfying
    the
    -min_slack
    criteria
    will
    be
    reported.
    The
    software
    will
    not
    process
    paths
    beyond
    the
    max_paths/nworst
    limit
    to
    find
    other

    that
    is

    2,
    then
    it

    in
    Tcl
    list
    format
    instead
    of
    a

    can
    be
    specified.
    Using
    -through_rise
    (or

    <pin_list>.
    
    The
    <pin_list>
    is
    a
    logical
    OR
    function.
    The
    resulting
    path
    may
    pass
    through
    any
    of
    the
    pins
    or
    nets

    You
    can
    use
    multi-thread
    mode
    for
    simultaneous
    setup
    and
    hold
    analysis.
    Multi-thread
    mode
    does
    use
    more
    memory
    than
    single-thread
    mode,
    but
    it
    improves
    the

    .P
    You
    can
    use
    the
    run_threaded_commands
    command
    in
    distributed
    MMMC
    mode
    to
    perform
    super

    .P
    The
    run_threaded_commands
    command
    should
    only
    be
    used
    when
    a
    command
    is
    not
    internally
    multi-threaded.
    This
    is
    because
    when
    this
    command
    is
    run
    threading
    takes
    place
    at
    the
    command
    level
    and
    each
    command
    runs
    with
    a
    single
    thread.
    So
    even
    if
    a
    command
    is
    multi-threaded
    internally,
    it
    does
    not
    utilize
    more
    than
    one
    thread.
    .P
    Note:
    Multiple
    threads
    writing
    to
    the
    same
    log
    file
    may
    cause
    run
    time
    degradation.
    It
    is
    recommended
    to

    the

    the

    files
    in
    order

    {  redirect {source generate_reports.tcl} > logfile_1  redirect
    {command2 } > logfile_2  .....  }

    Each

    the
    timing
    analysis
    state.
    In
    addition,
    the
    save_design
    command
    saves
    a
    Tempus
    design
    in
    the
    portable
    mode
    by
    default.
    In
    this
    mode,
    the
    design
    and
    library
    data
    do
    not
    have
    any
    path
    dependency.
    As
    a
    result,
    the
    saved
    database
    can
    be
    restored
    from
    any
    directory
    within
    the
    same
    network.
    The
    saved
    database
    can
    also
    be
    moved
    to
    any
    directory
    within
    the
    same
    network
    without
    any
    change.
    .P
    The
    software
    saves
    all
    library
    data
    (.lib,
    .cdB,
    and
    LEF
    files)
    as
    absolute
    paths
    in
    the
    configuration
    file,
    so
    that
    the
    saved
    design
    can
    be
    read
    from
    any
    directory.
    .P
    The
    command
    also
    writes
    out
    a
    power
    constraints
    file
    called
    topcellname_power_constraints.tcl
    which
    can
    be
    sourced
    into
    other
    Voltus/Tempus
    sessions.
    .P
    The
    save_design
    command
    does
    not
    save
    physical
    data
    (placement,
    routing,
    and
    floorplan
    information).
    If
    the
    software
    is
    in
    physical
    mode,
    the
    save_design
    command
    copies
    the
    physical
    data
    (floorplan,
    placement,
    routing
    and
    DEF)
    from
    a

    in
    the

    being

    to
    make
    the
    saved
    session
    complete.
    .P
    Note:
    By
    default,
    the
    save_design
    command
    cannot
    write
    out
    any
    modified
    physical
    data
    (e.g.,
    from
    reading
    DEF
    files
    or
    from
    any
    commands
    used
    to
    modify
    the
    physical

    unless
    you
    include
    the
    Innovus
    license
    at
    startup.
    You
    can
    add
    one
    of
    the
    possible
    Innovus
    licenses
    by
    using
    the
    tempus
    -lic_startup_extra
    option
    when
    Tempus
    is
    started.
    
    
    .SH
    Parameters
    
    
    
    "\fB-help\fR"
    Prints
    out
    the
    command
    usage.
    
    
    "\fB-cellview
    <string>\fR"
    Saves
    an
    OpenAccess
    design
    for
    the
    Tempus
    physical
    flow.
    
    "\fB-def\fR"
    Saves
    the
    design
    in
    the
    DEF
    file.
    
    To
    use
    this
    option,
    you
    need
    to
    specify
    the
    following
    parameter:
    
    tempus
    -lic_startup_extra
    invs
    
    "\fB-keep_partial\fR"
    Keeps
    the
    partially
    saved
    database
    for
    debugging
    purposes
    only,
    because
    restoring
    this
    database
    is
    not
    recommended.
    
    If
    the
    save_design
    command
    does
    not
    complete
    successfully,
    the
    session
    data
    will
    be
    removed
    by
    default.
    
    "\fB-libs\fR"
    Normally
    external
    file
    references,
    such
    as
    references
    to
    .lib,
    are
    saved
    using
    symbolic
    links
    to
    the
    original
    files
    inside
    a
    libs
    sub-directory
    inside
    the
    DB
    directory.
    
    This
    option
    forces
    copies
    of
    the
    files,
    rather
    than
    symbolic
    links,
    in
    the
    libs
    sub-directory
    so
    there
    are
    no
    external
    file
    references.
    This
    makes
    the
    DB
    directory
    much
    larger,
    but
    it
    is
    suitable
    for
    sending
    to
    a
    different
    network
    where
    the
    library
    and
    external
    data
    files
    are
    not
    available.
    
    "\fB-no_timing_graph\fR"
    Skips
    the
    saving
    of
    the
    timing
    graph
    by
    default.
    This
    saves
    time
    by
    preventing
    the
    timing
    update
    to
    occur
    in
    the
    case
    of
    designs
    where
    no
    timing
    graph
    is
    generated
    for
    the
    session.
    
    
    "\fB-overwrite\fR"
    Overwrites
    any
    previously
    saved
    session
    that
    has
    the
    same
    <session_name>.dat
    with
    the
    new
    session.
    
    By
    default,
    the
    software
    checks
    if
    the
    <session_name>.dat
    exists
    in
    the
    design.
    If
    it
    does,
    the
    software
    generates
    an
    error
    and
    does
    not
    execute
    the
    save_design
    command.
    If
    you
    specify
    the
    -overwrite
    parameter,
    the
    software
    removes
    the
    previously
    saved
    session,
    and
    then
    saves
    the
    new
    one.
    
    "\fB-noRc\fR"
    Does
    not
    allow
    RC
    parasitic
    information
    to
    be
    saved.
    
    You
    can
    use
    this
    option
    when
    input
    is
    already
    rcdb
    and
    you
    do
    not
    want
    to
    replicate
    it
    in
    the
    saved
    session.
    
    "\fB<session>\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    user-defined
    name
    of
    the
    current
    Tempus
    session.
    The
    associated

    All

    can
    be
    loaded
    into
    Tempus
    on
    a

    network.

    You
    can
    exit
    Tempus
    after
    using
    the
    command.
    This
    is
    to

    timing
    constraints
    file
    pointing
    to
    the
    testcase
    directory.
    Given
    that
    the

    is
    considered
    temporary,

    may
    be

    even
    deleted,
    a

    Exiting
    Tempus

    database
    will
    avoid

    usage.
    
    
    "\fB-cond
    <expression>\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    sdf
    condition
    of
    the
    selected
    timing
    arcs.
    
    
    Default:
    The
    delay
    applies
    to
    all
    the
    timing
    arcs
    selected
    using
    the
    -from

    the
    -to
    options.
    The
    expression
    is
    ignored
    for
    net
    arcs.
    
    Note:
    You
    cannot
    specify
    the
    -cond
    parameter

    be
    annotated
    to
    the
    selected
    timing
    arcs.
    
    "\fB-delta_only\fR"
    Populates
    the
    incremental
    delay
    slot
    with
    the
    delay
    value,
    so
    that
    you
    can
    differentiate
    between
    the
    base
    net
    delay
    and
    a
    delay
    offset
    that
    is
    due
    to
    crosstalk.
    The
    software
    reports
    the
    incremental
    (or
    delta)
    delay
    value
    separately
    in
    the
    timing
    report
    using
    report_timing
    -format
    incr_delay,
    and
    maintains
    the
    separate
    value
    for
    CPPR
    calculations.
    
    If
    the
    base
    delay
    was
    previously
    calculated
    or
    annotated
    from
    the
    SDF,
    the
    -delta_only
    parameter
    adds
    the
    specified
    delay
    to
    the
    existing
    base
    delay.
    
    Note:
    This
    parameter
    only
    can
    be
    used
    with
    the
    -net
    parameter;
    you
    cannot
    specify
    it
    with
    the
    -cell
    parameter.
    
    "\fB-from
    <from_pins>\fR"
    Specifies
    timing
    arcs
    to
    which
    the
    delay
    applies.
    The

    displayed.
    
    "\fB-increment\fR"
    Increments
    the
    specified
    delay
    value
    on
    top
    of
    the
    existing
    base
    delay
    value.
    
    "\fB-min

    Specifies
    the
    annotated
    delay
    for
    a
    particular
    operating
    corner.
    You
    can
    apply

    to
    cell
    arcs
    or
    net
    arcs.
    
    "\fB-rise/-fall\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    transition
    to
    which
    the
    delay
    applies.
    For
    cell
    arc,
    this
    is
    the
    output
    transition.
    
    Default:
    The
    delay
    applies
    to
    both
    transitions.
    
    "\fB-to
    <to_pins>\fR"
    Specifies
    timing
    arcs
    to
    which
    the
    delay
    applies.
    The
    selected
    timing
    arcs

    of
    the
    clock
    is
    high
    or
    low.
    Timing

    performs
    the
    check
    on
    the
    non-controlling
    value
    of
    the
    clock.
    By
    default,
    the
    software
    determines
    the
    non-controlling
    value
    of
    the
    clock
    using
    information
    from
    the
    gate's

    For
    example,
    for
    OR
    gates
    the
    non-controlling
    value
    is
    low.
    For
    complex
    gates,
    such
    as
    XOR
    and
    MUX,
    the
    clock
    is
    never
    controlling
    and
    it
    does
    not
    perform
    checks
    unless
    you
    specify
    either
    the
    -high
    option
    or
    the
    -low
    option.
    The
    specified
    value
    takes
    precedence
    over
    the
    default
    values.
    This
    option
    can
    only
    be
    used
    with
    pins
    or
    instances.
    
    Note:
    The
    clock
    pin
    value
    is
    controlling
    if
    it
    causes
    the

    "\fB<object_list>\fR"
    Specifies
    a
    list
    of
    clocks,
    instances,
    or
    pins.
    If
    a

    .P
    An
    alternative
    to
    setting
    the
    clocks
    as
    physically
    or
    logically
    exclusive
    using
    the
    set_clock_groups

    is
    to
    use
    the
    multi-mode

    Generally
    in
    an
    implementation
    flow,
    sequential
    setting
    of
    active
    clocks
    cannot
    be
    used.
    For
    concurrent
    analysis

    use
    an
    multi-mode

    "\fB-allow_paths\fR"
    Allows
    paths
    between
    asynchronous
    clock
    groups
    to
    be
    traced
    in
    timing
    analysis.
    These
    paths
    are
    blocked
    by
    default.
    When
    you
    use
    this
    option,
    the
    software
    still
    considers
    the
    paths
    to
    be
    asynchronous
    for
    signal
    integrity
    considerations.
    Signal
    integrity
    analysis
    does
    not
    support
    the
    -allow_paths
    parameter.
    Use
    the
    -allow_paths
    parameter
    with
    the
    -asynchronous
    parameter.
    
    "\fB-asynchronous\fR"
    Defines
    clock
    group
    with
    asynchronous
    clocks.
    Asynchronous
    clocks
    have
    no
    specified
    phase
    relationship.
    The
    software
    considers
    asynchronous
    nets
    to
    have
    infinite
    timing
    window
    overlap
    for
    signal
    integrity
    considerations
    and
    considers
    these
    as
    false
    paths
    for
    timing
    analysis.
    Use
    the
    -allow_paths
    parameter
    to
    trace
    these
    paths
    in
    timing
    analysis.
    
    "\fB-comment
    <string>\fR"
    Allows
    you
    to
    insert
    comments.
    The
    comments
    are
    read
    but
    are
    ignored
    with
    a
    one-time
    warning
    message.
    They
    are
    not
    used
    during
    timing
    analysis
    reporting
    nor
    are
    they
    written
    out
    during
    saving

    "\fB-group
    <clock_list>\fR"
    Defines
    a
    set
    of
    clocks
    that
    are
    exclusive
    or
    asynchronous
    to
    the
    clocks
    defined
    in
    all
    other
    groups.
    If
    you
    define
    only
    one
    group,
    then
    all
    clocks
    not
    in
    the
    group
    implicitly
    belong
    to
    a
    default
    clock
    group.
    The
    software
    automatically
    adds
    any
    new
    clocks
    that
    you
    define
    after
    the
    set_clock_groups
    command
    to
    this
    default
    clock
    group.
    
    "\fB-logically_exclusive\fR"
    Defines
    clock
    group
    with
    clocks
    that
    do
    not
    have
    any
    functional
    paths
    between
    them,
    but
    coexist
    in
    the
    design
    at
    the
    same
    time.
    The
    software
    considers
    aggressor
    interactions
    between
    these
    clocks
    for
    signal
    integrity
    considerations,
    but
    considers
    these
    as
    false
    paths
    for
    timing
    analysis.
    
    Note:
    The
    -logically_exclusive
    parameter
    does
    not
    have
    any
    impact
    on
    SI
    analysis.
    
    For
    example,
    clocks
    selected
    via
    a
    clock
    mux
    select.
    
    "\fB-name
    <name_list>\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    names
    of
    the
    clock
    groups
    to
    be
    added.
    
    "\fB-physically_exclusive\fR"
    Defines
    clock
    group
    with
    clocks
    that
    cannot
    exist
    in
    the
    design
    at
    the
    same
    time.
    The
    software
    does
    not
    consider
    aggressor
    interactions
    between
    clock
    groups
    that
    are
    physically
    exclusive
    for
    signal
    integrity
    considerations.
    
    From
    the
    perspective
    of
    SI
    analysis,
    all
    attackers
    that
    are
    physically
    exclusive
    with
    the
    victim
    net
    are
    ignored
    for
    both
    glitch
    and
    noise-on-delay
    analysis.
    Attacker
    nets
    that
    belong
    to
    physically
    exclusive
    groups
    cannot
    attack
    together.
    In
    this
    case,
    all
    sets
    of
    attackers
    belonging
    to
    all
    the
    physically
    exclusive
    groups
    are
    evaluated
    and
    the

    that
    has
    the

    SI
    analysis
    is
    chosen.
    
    For
    timing
    analysis,
    the

    You
    can
    use
    this
    command

    specify
    user-defined
    activities
    at
    the

    .SH
    Parameters
    
    
    
    "\fB-clip_activity_to_domain_freq
    {true | false}\fR"
    Specifies
    to
    perform
    domain-based
    activity
    clipping.
    This
    parameter
    clips
    data
    paths
    to
    1x
    frequency
    whereas
    the
    clock
    networks
    are
    still
    at
    2x
    frequency.
    This
    parameter
    allows
    you
    to
    have
    more
    control
    to
    determine
    the
    rate
    of
    clipping
    with
    respect
    to
    frequency.
    
    
    "\fB-clock_gates_enable
    {<activity_factor>}\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    activity
    at
    the
    enable
    pin(s)
    of
    the
    clock
    gating
    cells.
    
    "\fB-clock_gates_output
    {<activity_factor>}\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    activity
    at
    the
    output
    pin(s)
    of
    the
    clock
    gating
    cells.
    This
    works
    for
    both
    ICGs
    as
    well
    as
    combinational
    clock
    gating
    cells.
    
    
    "\fB-clock_gates_output_ratio
    <num>\fR"
    Specifies
    to
    control
    transition
    density
    at
    the
    output
    pin(s)
    of
    the
    integrated
    and
    combinational
    clock
    gating
    cells.
    This
    parameter
    is
    equivalent
    to
    specifying
    the
    parameters
    -icg_ratio
    and
    -comb_clockgate_ratio
    together
    with
    the
    same
    value.
    
    For
    example,
    the
    set_default_switching_activity
    -clock_gates_output_ratio
    0.6
    is
    equivalent
    to
    set_default_switching_activity
    -icg_ratio
    0.6
    -comb_clockgate_ratio
    0.6.
    
    Note:
    This
    parameter
    has
    a
    cascading
    effect
    when
    there
    are
    multiple
    levels
    of
    ICG
    cells
    on
    the
    clock
    path.
    For
    example,
    when
    -clock_gates_output_ratio
    is
    set
    to
    0.5,
    the
    first
    level
    ICG
    cell
    will
    have
    0.5
    ratio
    of
    the
    root
    clock's
    toggle
    density,
    the
    second
    level
    ICG
    cell
    will
    have
    0.5*0.5=0.25
    ratio
    of
    the
    root
    clock's
    toggle
    density,
    and
    the
    third
    level
    ICG
    cell
    will
    have
    0.5*0.5*0.5=0.125
    ratio
    of
    the
    root
    clock's
    toggle
    density,
    and
    so
    on.
    
    "\fB-comb_clockgate_ratio
    <num>\fR"
    Specifies
    to
    set
    the
    propagation
    ratio
    for
    combinational
    clock
    gate
    cell
    outputs.
    When
    specified,
    this
    parameter
    sets
    the
    output
    activity
    of
    any
    instance
    that
    is
    identified
    as
    a
    combinational
    clock
    gating
    cell
    to
    <num>
    times
    the
    fastest
    transition
    density
    arriving
    on
    the
    instance's
    clock
    inputs.
    
    Note:
    This
    parameter
    does
    not
    apply
    to
    combinational
    clockgates
    with
    a
    constant
    data
    input,
    that
    is,
    a
    select
    pin
    tied
    low.
    
    "\fB-duty
    <value>\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    duty
    cycle,
    which
    is
    the
    probability
    that
    the
    signal
    is
    a
    logical
    1.
    
    Note:
    You
    must
    specify
    the
    -period
    parameter
    when
    assigning
    a
    duty.
    
    Default:
    0.5
    (equivalent
    to
    a
    50
    percent
    duty
    cycle)
    
    "\fB-global_activity
    <factor>\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    average
    number
    of
    times
    that
    all
    unset
    nodes
    switch
    in
    a
    clock
    cycle.
    If
    not
    specified
    the
    fastest
    domain
    frequency
    will
    be
    used
    unless
    one
    turns
    off
    clock
    domains.
    
    "\fB-hier
    <hierarchy_name>\fR"
    A
    hierarchical
    name
    that
    the
    global
    activity
    is
    being
    assigned
    to.
    If
    not
    provided,
    the
    whole
    design
    is
    assumed.
    
    "\fB-icg_ratio
    <num>\fR"
    Specifies
    to
    set
    the
    propagation
    ratio
    for
    integrated
    clock
    gate
    (ICG)
    cell
    outputs.
    When
    specified,
    this
    parameter
    sets
    the
    output
    pin
    of
    all
    identified
    ICG
    instances
    to
    <num>
    times
    the
    fastest
    transition
    density
    arriving
    on
    clock
    inputs
    of
    the
    instance.
    
    "\fB-input_activity
    <factor>\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    average
    number
    of
    times
    that
    a
    primary
    input
    switches
    in
    a
    clock
    cycle.
    It
    can
    be
    any
    positive
    number.
    
    Default:
    0.2
    (Switches
    once
    every
    five
    clock
    cycles.)
    
    "\fB-macro_activity
    <factor>\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    activity
    factor
    for
    macros
    in
    a
    design.
    The
    allowed
    values
    for
    this
    parameter
    are
    between
    0
    to
    1.
    
    If
    you
    set
    the
    macro
    activity
    to
    .30,
    30%
    of
    macros
    in
    the
    design
    would
    be
    selected
    for
    switching
    in
    a
    given
    cycle
    during
    dynamic
    simulation.
    When
    -macro_activity
    is
    specified
    for
    the
    static
    power
    analysis,
    all
    output
    pins
    of
    the
    macros
    are
    assigned
    the
    specified
    activity.
    
    Default:
    0.2
    
    "\fB-name
    <activity_name>\fR"
    Allows
    you
    to
    set
    the
    activity
    level
    for
    the
    specified
    jitter
    activity
    name.
    You
    can
    define
    a
    low/high
    activity
    level
    for
    jitter
    analysis.
    
    Examples:
    
    set_default_switching_activity
    
    
    
    
    
    -name
    low
    -clock_gates_output

    -clock_gates_output
    2
    -global_activity
    0.2
    
    "\fB-period
    <value>\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    default
    operating
    period
    (1/frequency).
    
    Specifies
    the
    period
    that
    the
    activity
    is
    referenced
    to.
    If
    not
    specified,
    the
    software
    uses
    the
    dominant
    clock
    in
    the
    design.
    
    If
    no
    clock
    is
    specified,
    the
    software
    generates
    an
    error
    and
    prompts
    you
    to
    enter
    one.

    Note:
    If
    you
    enter
    the
    period
    as
    a
    negative
    number,
    the
    software
    reverts
    back
    to
    using
    the
    default
    frequency.
    
    Default:
    The
    time

    is
    defined
    in
    the
    first
    .lib
    file
    read
    during
    design
    import.
    
    "\fB-seq_activity
    <factor>\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    activity
    of
    outputs
    of
    the
    sequential
    logic.
    This
    value
    will
    be
    used
    at
    the
    output
    ports
    of
    flops
    for
    propagating
    activity.
    
    If
    the
    sequential
    activity
    is
    not
    specified,
    propagation
    will
    be
    done
    for
    the
    full
    design
    starting
    from
    the
    input
    ports.
    
    "\fB-reset\fR"
    Resets
    all
    specified
    options
    back
    to
    default
    values.
    
    "\fB-reset_type
    { global_activity | seq_activity ... }\fR"
    Specifies
    to
    selectively
    reset
    the
    global
    specifications.
    
    Note:
    You
    must
    use
    the
    -reset_type
    parameter
    in
    conjunction
    with
    the

    Parameters
    
    
    "\fB-help\fR"
    Prints
    out
    the
    command
    usage.
    
    
    "\fB-add
    <string>\fR"
    Adds
    the
    specified
    hosts
    to
    the
    rsh/ssh
    configuration.
    If
    you
    specify
    more
    than
    one
    host,
    separate
    each
    host
    name
    with
    a
    space.
    
    Each
    time
    you
    specify
    a
    host,
    the
    software
    uses
    it
    to
    run
    one
    client
    process.
    To
    run
    more
    than
    one
    client
    process
    on
    a
    host,
    specify
    it
    more
    than
    once.
    For
    example,
    if
    you
    have
    two
    machines
    that
    each
    has
    two
    CPUs
    and
    you
    want
    to
    use
    both
    CPUs
    in
    both
    machines,
    type
    a
    command
    like
    the
    following:
    
    setDistributeHost
    -rsh
    -add
    {<machine1> <machine2>\\    <machine1> <machine2>}
    
    "\fB-args
    <string>\fR"
    Specifies
    any
    additional
    arguments
    you
    need
    to
    provide
    to
    the
    Sun
    Grid
    Engine
    (SGE)
    or
    Load
    Sharing
    Facility
    (LSF)
    job
    submission
    command.
    
    "\fB-custom\fR"
    Specifies
    to
    use
    the
    custom
    job
    submission
    script
    for
    distributed
    processing.
    
    
    "\fB-custom_script
    <string>
    
    \fR"
    Specifies
    a
    custom
    script
    to
    run
    distributed
    processing.
    
    You
    can
    use
    this
    parameter
    with
    -custom
    only.
    
    "\fB-custom_script_list
    <string>\fR"
    Specifies
    to
    customize
    the
    launch
    of
    multiple
    jobs,
    based
    on
    resources
    required
    for
    these
    jobs.
    This
    parameter
    allows
    you
    to
    specify
    multiple
    launch
    strings
    in
    order
    of
    priority
    with
    a
    maximum
    allowed
    job
    count
    for
    each
    string.
    
    If
    you
    request
    for
    N
    number
    of
    jobs,
    the
    command
    starts
    submitting
    jobs
    starting
    from
    <string1>,
    until
    the
    corresponding
    count
    is
    reached,
    at
    which
    point
    it
    starts
    submitting
    the
    next
    string
    in
    the
    list.
    Therefore,
    the
    command
    submits
    the
    first
    "<count1>"
    jobs
    with
    <string1>,
    the
    next
    "<count2>"
    jobs
    with
    <string2>
    and
    so
    on.
    It
    stops
    when
    the
    total
    submitted
    jobs
    has
    reached
    the
    requested
    number
    (N).
    
    Note:
    This
    parameter
    can
    only
    be
    specified
    with
    the
    -custom
    parameter.
    
    "\fB-env_script
    <string>\fR"
    Specifies
    a
    user-defined
    shell
    environment
    script
    that
    is
    run
    for
    each
    of
    the
    client
    hosts.
    The
    parameter
    allows
    you
    to
    pass
    these
    environment
    settings
    to
    the
    client
    hosts
    by
    including
    them
    in
    the
    shell
    environment
    script.
    The
    license
    variables
    used
    by
    the
    software
    are
    also
    automatically
    passed
    to
    the
    client
    hosts
    to
    avoid
    license
    errors.
    
    
    "\fB-local\fR"
    Runs
    all
    distributed
    processing
    jobs
    on
    the
    master
    machine.
    
    "\fB-lsf\fR"
    Specifies
    a
    Load
    Sharing
    Facility
    configuration.
    If
    you
    do
    not
    specify
    any
    parameters
    for
    -lsf
    ,
    the
    software
    uses
    default
    settings.
    
    Note:
    To
    use
    this
    parameter,
    LSF
    must
    already
    be
    set
    up
    (typically
    by
    specifying
    the
    LSF_ENVDIR
    and
    LSF_SERVERDIR
    environment
    variables)
    and
    bsub
    must
    be
    in
    your
    search
    path.
    Contact
    your
    LSF
    administrator
    for
    details.
    
    "\fB-nc\fR"

    Computer
    from
    RTDA)
    for
    distributed
    processing.
    
    "\fB-noWaitTaskComeUp\fR"
    Does
    not
    allow
    the
    software
    to
    wait
    for
    tasks
    that
    are
    delayed
    or
    are
    not
    likely
    to
    occur.
    
    
    "\fB-queue
    <string>\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    queue
    for
    the
    LSF
    or
    SGE
    configuration.
    
    "\fB-remove
    <string>\fR"
    Removes
    the
    specified
    hosts
    or
    all
    hosts
    from
    the
    rsh/ssh
    configuration.
    If
    you
    specify
    more
    than
    one
    host,
    separate
    each
    host
    name
    with
    a
    space.
    
    "\fB-reportLsfInfo\fR"
    Specifies
    to
    report
    LSF
    information

    Note:
    The
    correct
    resource
    string
    is
    specific
    to
    your
    installation.
    Contact
    your

    This
    may
    be
    a

    of
    CPUs
    you
    are

    .P
    To
    model
    the
    drive
    capability
    of
    the
    external
    driver,
    the
    timing

    computes
    an
    offset
    to
    the

    used
    to
    compute
    the

    the

    The
    timing
    analyzer
    computes
    the

    subtracting
    the
    zero
    load

    the
    total

    of
    the

    The
    set_driving_cell

    uses
    the

    "\fB-legal_only
    {true|false}]\fR" Enables the tool to use the physical data
    to search for legal location while doing any buffer insertion
    or instance movement. This ensures that there is no instance
    overlap at the end of the ECO fixing stage, and after sourcing
    the ECO file in the implementation tool, you can directly
    run ECO routing.  When this parameter is set to false, eco_opt_design
    will not check for legal location although physical data
    is provided. In this mode, eco_opt_design behaves in a logical
    mode flow, which means that physical data will be ignored
    and this might create an instance overlap and will not check
    local density while inserting buffers. Also, the routing
    congestion checks are skipped when this parameter is set
    to false. So it is recommended that you first run ECO fixing
    in the legal-only mode (which is the default mode) and then,
    depending on the requirement, you may perform an incremental
    run by setting -legal_only to false.  Default: true  Note:
    .RS  "*" 2 The -legal_only parameter is also honored by the
    Setup/Hold/DRV fixing engines.  "*" 2 If set, this parameter
    must be applied before eco_opt_design. .RE   "\fB-load_cell_list

    inserted during Hold fixing.  Note: If set, this parameter
    must be applied before eco_opt_design.  "\fB-load_eco_opt_db
    name\fR" Specifies the path of the directory where previously
    generated ECO Timing DB files are kept. If not specified,
    the ECO Timing DB files will be generated.  Default=""  Note:
    If set, this parameter must be applied before eco_opt_design.
     "\fB-load_irdrop_db name\fR" Specifies the path of the directory
    where command, debug_irdrop, generated IR drop DB files are
    kept.  Default=""  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied
    before eco_opt_design.  "\fB-load_smart_mmmc_db <dirName>\fR"
    Points Tempus ECO to the ECO DB directory containing the
    additional compact timing information during the ECO fixing
    session. This parameter must be set before the design is
    loaded and must point to an ECO DB directory, which was previously
    generated through write_eco_opt_db using the setting,  set_eco_opt_mode
    -create_smart_mmmc_db true.  Note: Before eco_opt_design,
    you still need to point to the ECO DB directory using the
    setting, set_eco_opt_mode -load_eco_opt_db <dirName>.  "\fB-max_cap_margin
    <float>\fR" Specifies the ratio by which the max_capacitance
    constraints would be relaxed or tightened. The parameter
    takes values between the range of -10 and 0.99  Default:0
     Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before eco_opt_design.
     "\fB-max_slack <FLOAT>\fR" Specifies the maximum slack value
    to be used during ECO Timing DB generation.  Default: 0 
    Note:  .RS  "*" 2 This parameter is only active when the
    -retime option is being set.   "*" 2 If set, this parameter
    must be applied before write_eco_opt_db.  .RE   "\fB-max_paths
    <paths>\fR" Specifies the worst path found for each endpoint
    up to the number specified by the -max_paths parameter during
    ECO Timing DB generation. By default, the tool will automatically
    set a value for -max_paths that would lead to good PBA coverage
    of the design within reasonable run time. You can overwrite
    this by setting a specific -max_paths value, but it is recommended
    to keep it larger than 1 million. In any case, you must ensure
    that -max_paths value is superior or equal than the -nworst
    value multiplied by the number of GBA violated endpoints.
     Default : -1  Note: .RS  "*" 2 This parameter is only active
    when the -retime parameter is set.  "*" 2 If set, this parameter
    must be applied before write_eco_opt_db. .RE   "\fB-max_run_time
    <minutes>\fR" Specifies the time out period after which eco_opt_design
    will exit the session.  Note: If set, this parameter must
    be applied before eco_opt_design.   "\fB-max_tran_margin
    <float>\fR" Specifies the ratio by which the max_transition
    constraints would be relaxed or tightened. The parameter
    takes values between the range of -10 and 0.99.  Default:
    0.  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before eco_opt_design.
      "\fB-nworst <INT>\fR" Specifies the number of paths to
    be enumerated for each endpoint. By default, the tool will
    automatically set a value for -nworst that would lead to
    a good PBA coverage of the design within reasonable run time.
    You can overwrite this by setting a specific -nworst value,
    but it is recommended to keep it larger than 50.  Default
    : -1  Note: .RS  "*" 2 This parameter is only active when
    the -retime parameter is set.  "*" 2 If set, this parameter
    must be applied before write_eco_opt_db. .RE   "\fB-optimize_core_only
    {true|false}\fR" When set to true, enables the tool to automatically
    skip the timing optimization on the IO paths in order to
    focus only on the internal register to register paths. However,
    when set to true for leakage and area optimization, the tool
    doesn't touch any instances, which would be part of an IO
    path in order to avoid creating any new timing violations
    on the IO paths.  Default: false   Note:  .RS  "*" 2 This
    parameter is not applicable for DRV optimization.  "*" 2
    If set, this parameter must be applied before eco_opt_design.
     .RE   "\fB-optimize_replicated_modules {true|false}\fR"
    By enabling the -optimize_replicated_modules parameter, the
    tool will be able to optimize timing in the replicated modules.
    Any netlist change will be checked against each clone's timing
    and physical context to ensure that no violations are created.
     In this mode, only one ECO file is generated per group of
    clones. It is mandatory to list the cell name of the clones
    inside the file specified with the -partition_list_file parameter.
     Default: false  Note: .RS  "*" 2 The design must be assembled
    in Tempus through the merge_hierarchical_def command. You
    can also load an assembled DB from Innovus. This parameter
    works only in the physical mode optimization.  "*" 2 If set,
    this parameter must be applied before eco_opt_design. .RE
      "\fB-optimize_sequential_cells {true|false}\fR" Enables
    the timing optimizer to optimize the sequential cells. In
    addition, it performs VT swapping and resizing of sequential
    cells.  Default : true   Note: If set, this parameter must
    be applied before eco_opt_design.  "\fB-partition_list_file
    <string>\fR" Enables the software to select the hierarchical
    instances that should be treated as partitions. The file
    specified with this parameter must contain a list of module
    names of those hierarchical instances. The eco_opt_design
    command will generate an ECO file for the top module and
    the partitions (with relative placement locations for cells).
     Default: empty  Notes: .RS  "*" 2 It is mandatory that the
    modules that are treated as partitions are of type FENCE.
     "*" 2 To avoid performing ECO in a given partition, you
    need to apply dont_touch attribute on that module.  "*" 2
    To perform top-level buffering only, you need to apply dont_touch
    on all the partitions.  "*" 2 If set, this parameter must
    be applied before eco_opt_design.  .RE   Example:  Consider
    a design having the following modules: .RS  "*" 2 A module,
    blockA, being replicated twice with the hierarchical instances
    name, top/blockA_1 and top/blockA_2.  "*" 2 A second module,
    blockB, being replicated twice with hierarchical instances
    name, top/blockB_1 and top/blockB_2.  "*" 2 A third module,
    blockC, which has only one instance, top/blockC_1. .RE  
    In this case, the partition list file must contain the given
    below modules.  blockA  blockB  blockC  "\fB-pba_effort {medium|high}\fR"
    Creates a high or medium effort PBA mode honored by all optimization
    engines. When set to high, all optimization engines perform
    more aggressive timing closure or area/power recovery with
    respect to PBA timing and the expectation is to get better
    quality of results.  In some cases, when large amount of
    ECOs are done in this mode, the final timing signoff might
    show some setup timing degradation, which can be recovered
    by running a second ECO loop doing only setup timing recovery
    with the set_eco_opt_mode -setup_recovery parameter set to
    true.  Default: medium  Note: If set, this parameter must
    be applied before write_eco_opt_db and eco_opt_design.  "\fB-post_mask{true|false}\fR"
    Enables the timing closure engine to perform the following
    netlist changes without touching the base layer mask: .RS
     "*" 2 Inserts the Gate Array buffers or an inverter pair
    in place of existing Gate Array filler cells.  "*" 2 Resizes
    regular cells to Gate Array cells. It also resize Gate Array
    cells to Gate Array cells.  "*" 2 Deletes a regular cell.
    .RE   The software automatically identifies the Gate Array
    cells by checking which library instances have the same SITE
    name as the Gate Array filler cells specified by the user.
    Here, empty spaces will be filled up by the Gate Array filler
    cells to ensure 100% placement density.  Note: .RS  "*" 2
    This is supported by DRV, Setup, and Hold fixing.  "*" 2
    When setTieHiLoMode -cell {{<tieLo_name> <tieHi_name>}} setting
    is used, the Metal ECO flow will insert the TieLo cells to
    connect dangling input pins, in case the existing TieLo cells
    in the floorplan are extremely far or too overloaded. .RE
      Default: false  "\fB-post_sta_tcl file\fR" Specifies the
    file containing the TCL code that will be executed immediately
    after signoff timing analysis per view.  Default: " " (empty
    string)  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before
    write_eco_opt_db.  "\fB-power_aware{true|false}\fR" Specifies
    power awareness in all optimizers and transforms.  Tempus
    ECO provides the ability to take power as part of the overall
    cost function when doing timing closure.  When this parameter
    is enabled before the start of an optimization session, the
    current optimization and any subsequent optimizations (if
    running in incremental mode) checks for power changes for
    all optimizers and transforms during any changes in the design.
     In any of the above cases, the first priority remains getting
    best final timing but enabling this option will get there
    with possibly slighter ECO although resulting in lesser final
    power.  For example, while fixing a Setup timing path violation,
    by default, the tool chooses to size one instance to a high
    leakage cell, while with the -power_aware mode, the tool
    tries to get to same timing by doing multiple sizing to non-high
    leakage cells.  Note : .RS  "*" 2 This feature requires power
    activity to be annotated on the netlist with the report_power
    command, either through external activity file (recommended)
    or using propagated activity based on some default toggling
    rate.  "*" 2 This feature honors the -power_opt_focus parameter,
    which means that you can decide to force the tool in reducing
    more the total or leakage or dynamic power increase. .RE
      Default: false  "\fB-power_opt_focus {total|leakage|dynamic}\fR"
    Specifies whether a given netlist should be optimized more
    for Leakage or Dynamic power, while still reducing the overall
    total power during the total power optimization.  The options
    are described below: .RS  "*" 2  total: When this option
    is specified, the power optimization engine focuses on getting
    the optimal Total Power in the design.  "*" 2  leakage: In
    this mode, the power optimization engine will optimize Total
    Power but focuses more on Leakage power reduction over Dynamic
    power reduction.  "*" 2  dynamic: When specified, the power
    optimization engine will optimize Total Power but focuses
    more on Dynamic power reduction over Leakage power reduction.
    .RE   Default: total   Note: .RS  "*" 2 The -power_opt_focus
    parameter is honored by eco_opt_design -power only.  "*"
    2 If set, this parameter must be applied before eco_opt_design.
      .RE   "\fB-pre_sta_tcl <file>\fR" Specifies a file containing
    the TCL code that will be executed immediately prior to signoff
    timing analysis per view.  Default: " " (empty string)  Note:
    If set, this parameter must be applied before write_eco_opt_db.
     "\fB-prefix_name <string>\fR" Specifies the prefix to be
    assigned to the new instances inserted.  Default: ESO  Note:
    If set, this parameter must be applied before eco_opt_design.
     "\fB-pruned_block_name <string>\fR" Specifies a module name
    or hierarchical instance name. The ECO timing DB is generated
    for the selected block. In addition, an SDC file per view
    with the name, <hinst_name>_<view>.sdc, is also generated
    and is saved in the same directory where ECO DB file is saved.
     Default: ""  Note:  .RS  "*" 2 Replicated module names are
    also supported.  "*" 2 If set, this parameter must be applied
    before write_eco_opt_db. .RE   "\fB-resize_inst {true | false}\fR"
    Enables or disables the resizing of cells. This parameter
    is applicable to setup, hold, and DRV optimization. In setup
    optimization, resizing also includes delay-to-buffer conversion
    whereas in hold optimization, resizing is limited to buffer-to-delay
    conversion only.  Default: true  Note: If set, this parameter
    must be applied before eco_opt_design.   "\fB-retime <none
    | aocv | path_slew_propagation | aocv_path_slew_propagation>\fR"
    Supports PBA-based optimization for of all optimizers.  For
    detailed information of the parameter options, see report_timing.
     Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before write_eco_opt_db
    and eco_opt_design.  "\fB-routing_congestion_aware {true|false}\fR"
    Prevents doing ECO change in the design areas where routing
    congestion is very high. This will avoid causing any new
    routing DRC violations due to ECO buffering/resizing and
    routing detour for new ECO nets.  Default : false  Note:
    .RS  "*" 2 This parameter may lead to worse timing closure
    when design has routing congestion, but it will limit the
    potential Setup timing degradation and routing DRC increase
    after full place and route loop.  "*" 2 If set, this parameter
    must be applied before eco_opt_design. .RE   "\fB-save_eco_opt_db
    <dir_name>\fR" Path of directory where generated database
    files are kept.  Default: ecoTimingDB  Note: If set, this
    parameter must be applied before write_eco_opt_db.  "\fB-select_hold_endpoints
    <string>\fR" Specifies a file containing the list of selected
    endpoints for hold fixing.  Note:  .RS  "*" 2 When including
    endpoints, the -optimize_core_only parameter must be set
    to false.  "*" 2 This parameter is set during ECO optimization.
    .RE   For more details, see section, Optimization using Endpoint
    Control in Tempus User Guide.    "\fB-select_drv_net_file
    <FILE>\fR" Specifies a file containing the list of nets to
    be optimized during DRV fixing. The fixing of max_transition,
    max_capacitance, SI glitch, SI Xtalk, and SI Slew violations
    occurs only on the specified nets and the other violating
    nets are ignored. The file specified includes one net per
    line. When this parameter is used, the software prints the
    DRV summary only for the selected nets/terms under the headings,
    Selected Signal Nets and Selected Clock nets, respectively.
    It also specifies the reasons for the selected nets only
    in the failure summary.  Default= " " (empty string)  Note:

    endpoints, the -optimize_core_only parameter must be set
    to false.  "*" 2 If set, this parameter must be applied before
    eco_opt_design.   .RE   For more details, see section, Optimization
    using Endpoint Control in Tempus User Guide.   "\fB-setup_recovery
    {true|false}\fR" Recovers the Setup timing, which might have
    been degraded after large ECO change during Power optimization.
    When this parameter is enabled, the Setup optimization will
    be done with Vth swapping only, which means that the same
    size and same pin geometry cell sizing. Because of this,
    there is no need of re-routing the design and final timing
    can be generated.  Default: false  Note: If set, this parameter
    must be applied before eco_opt_design.    "\fB-setup_target_slack

    Specifies
    the
    capacitance
    filtering
    mode.
    The
    filtering
    modes
    are
    conditions
    which
    define

    combination.
    Based
    on
    the
    filtering
    mode
    specified,
    the
    software
    determines
    the

    which
    will
    have
    their
    coupling
    capacitance
    lumped

    ground.
    
    Note:
    The
    behavior
    of
    the
    -total_c_th
    filter
    is
    independent
    of
    the
    -capFilterMode

    setting.
    Nets

    lower
    than
    the
    value
    specified

    "\fB-compressOptMemRCDB

    Generates
    compressed
    RCDB
    data.
    
    Default:
    false
    
    Note:
    This
    functionality
    reduces
    the
    disk
    usage
    but
    leads

    "\fB-coupled
    {true | false}
    \fR"
    Separately

    coupling
    capacitance.
    The
    -coupled
    false
    value
    is
    typically
    used
    for
    static
    timing
    analysis.
    Signal
    integrity
    analysis
    requires
    the

    "\fB-coupling_c_th

    determines
    when
    the
    extractor
    lumps
    a
    net's
    coupling
    capacitance
    to
    ground.
    This
    parameter
    is
    applicable
    only
    when
    the
    -coupled
    parameter
    is
    set
    to
    true.
    
    The
    software
    decouples
    the
    coupling
    capacitance
    of
    nets
    when
    the
    total
    coupling
    capacitance
    between
    the

    of
    nets
    is
    lower
    than
    the
    threshold
    specified
    with
    this
    parameter.
    The
    actual
    decoupling
    also
    depends
    on
    the
    setting
    of
    the
    -capFilterMode

    only
    when
    the
    -coupled
    parameter
    is
    set

    "\fB-turboReduce

    Controls
    the
    turbo
    reduction
    feature
    for
    standalone
    Quantus
    extraction.
    
    Default:
    auto
    
    When
    set
    to
    auto,
    the
    software
    automatically
    turns
    on
    turbo
    reduction
    and
    proceeds
    when
    the
    required
    Quantus
    QRC
    license
    is
    available.
    However,
    if
    the
    required
    Quantus
    QRC
    license
    is
    not
    installed
    in
    the
    license
    server,
    the
    software
    automatically
    turns
    off
    Turbo
    reduction
    and
    proceeds
    with
    a
    warning
    message.
    If
    the
    license
    is
    installed
    in
    the
    license
    server
    but
    temporarily
    not
    available,
    then
    two
    scenarios
    are
    possible.
    First,
    if
    the
    license
    wait
    mode
    is
    not
    turned
    on,
    then
    Quantus
    will
    look
    for
    the
    license
    right
    away
    and
    error
    out
    because
    the
    license
    is
    not
    available.
    Second,
    if
    the
    license
    wait
    mode
    is
    turned
    on,
    then
    Quantus
    will
    wait
    and
    check
    for
    the
    license
    periodically
    until
    timeout.
    If
    the
    license
    is
    available
    before
    the
    timeout,
    turbo
    reduction
    will
    be
    performed
    but
    if
    the
    license
    is
    not
    available
    before
    timeout,
    QRC
    will
    error
    out.
    
    When
    set
    to
    true,
    the
    turbo
    reduction
    engine
    is
    on.
    However,
    if
    the
    required
    Quantus
    QRC
    license
    is
    not
    installed
    in
    the
    license
    server,
    then
    standalone
    Quantus
    will
    error
    out
    with
    a
    message
    and
    the
    run
    will
    stop.
    It
    is
    because
    setting
    the
    option
    to
    true
    means
    the
    user
    really
    wants
    to
    perform
    turbo
    reduction.
    
    When
    set
    to
    false,
    the
    turbo
    reduction
    engine
    is
    switched
    off.

    Default
    is

    Default:
    all
    
    "\fB-threshold_type
    {failure | reporting | propagation}\fR"
    Specifies
    whether
    the
    command
    options
    apply
    to
    failure,
    reporting,
    or
    propagation
    criteria.
    
    In
    case
    of
    VL/VH
    glitch
    analysis,
    it
    is
    mandatory
    to
    specify
    the
    âthreshold_type
    parameter.
    This
    is
    because
    when
    the
    computed
    glitch
    (ROP)
    at
    any
    given
    stage
    exceeds
    the
    failure
    threshold
    (when
    glitch
    propagation
    is
    enabled),
    then
    it
    is
    not
    propagated
    and
    is
    flagged
    as
    failure
    in
    the
    noise
    report.
    
    With
    the
    âthreshold_type
    failure
    setting,
    the
    propagation
    will
    stop
    as
    per
    the
    new
    threshold,
    and
    the
    failure
    flagging
    will
    change
    accordingly.
    However,
    with
    the
    âthreshold_type
    reporting
    setting,
    the
    propagation
    threshold
    remains
    unchanged,
    but
    the
    failure
    reporting
    is
    updated.
    
    When
    -threshold_type
    propagation
    is
    used,
    the
    software
    allows
    for
    failing
    nets
    with
    ROP
    values
    less
    than
    the
    propagation
    threshold
    to
    propagate
    through
    single
    stage
    cells.
    
    In
    case
    of
    VLU/VHO
    glitch
    analysis,
    it
    is
    optional
    to
    use
    the
    âthreshold_type
    parameter
    because
    the
    above
    flow
    is
    not
    applicable.
    
    Default:
    failure
    
    "\fB-value
    <float>\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    value
    for
    the
    threshold
    as
    a
    ratio
    of
    the
    local
    VDD.
    
    Default:
    0.1
    
    "\fB-views
    <string>\fR"
    Specifies
    a
    list
    of
    view
    names.

    that
    the

    constraints
    (SDC)
    files

    not
    contain
    any
    unit
    specification
    for
    capacitance
    and
    time
    values.
    Hence,
    the
    units
    for
    these

    are
    considered
    to
    be
    same
    as
    those
    specified
    in
    the
    timing
    libraries.
    The
    commands,
    e.g.,
    report_timing,
    require
    consistent
    units
    to
    generate
    reports.
    If
    an
    inconsistency
    occurs
    in
    the
    timing
    libraries
    then
    the
    default
    unit
    of
    time
    (as
    ns)
    and
    capacitance
    (as
    pf)

    the
    same
    as
    set
    by
    the
    set_load
    capacitance_value
    object_list
    command.
    
    When
    this
    parameter
    is
    not
    specified,
    the

    will
    only
    change
    the
    wire
    capacitance
    value
    from

    The

    The

    the

    the

    (the
    fastest
    clock
    domain,
    if
    there
    is
    more
    than
    one).
    If
    the
    instance

    a
    clock
    instance
    (that
    is,
    part
    of
    the
    clock
    tree),
    the
    actual
    clock
    frequency
    is
    used.
    If
    the

    is
    part

    only
    toggle
    at
    one-half
    the

    For

    The

    the

    (the

    clock
    domain,
    if
    there
    is
    more
    than
    one).
    If

    limit.
    When

    the
    limit
    applies
    to
    all
    the

    The

    Pins
    in
    the
    design
    inherit
    the
    limits
    from
    libraries.
    When

    Note:
    The
    limit
    set
    on
    the
    top
    timing

    Specifying

    identifies
    a

    If
    a

    cell
    name

    to
    output
    Q
    is
    also

    For

    starts
    from

    .P
    For
    the
    first
    command,
    the
    valid
    path
    starts
    from
    clk,
    and
    for
    the
    second
    command
    the
    valid

    starts
    from
    the
    Q
    output.
    In
    the
    second
    case,
    the
    path
    from
    clk
    to
    Q
    is
    not

    Specifies
    the
    clocks,

    or
    sequential
    instances
    that
    are
    at
    the
    start
    of
    the
    multicycle
    paths.
    
    The
    port
    direction
    can
    be
    either
    input
    or
    inout.
    Pins
    must
    be
    valid
    path
    startpoints
    such
    as
    sequential
    instance
    clock
    pins,
    latch
    data
    pins
    or
    pins
    on
    which
    input
    delays
    have
    been
    specified.
    Pins
    can
    be
    on
    intermediate
    hierarchical
    boundaries.
    The
    <from_list>
    variable
    can
    contain
    either
    collection
    IDs
    or
    object
    names.
    
    If
    the
    -from
    option
    is
    used
    without
    the
    -to
    option,
    all
    paths
    originating
    from
    the
    from_list
    are
    multicycle
    paths.
    
    Use
    either
    the
    -from,
    -to,
    or
    -through
    option
    with
    the
    set_multicycle_path
    command
    to
    identify
    the
    paths.
    
    Specifying
    both
    the
    -from
    and
    -to
    options
    identifies
    a
    path
    with
    specific
    starting
    and
    ending
    points.
    
    Use
    only
    one
    -from,
    -rise_from,
    or
    -fall_from
    option
    per
    command.
    
    "\fB-hold/-setup\fR"
    Specifies
    whether
    the
    multicycle
    adjustment
    applies
    to
    setup/hold
    check.
    
    The
    -setup
    parameter
    applies
    multicycles
    to
    setup
    check.
    The
    hold
    check
    is
    affected
    but
    the
    hold
    multiplier
    does
    not
    change.
    
    The
    -hold
    parameter
    applies
    multicycles
    to
    hold
    check
    only.
    
    Default:
    If
    you
    do
    not
    specify
    -setup
    or
    -hold
    parameter,
    the
    software
    considers
    the
    specified
    multicycle
    value
    for
    setup
    check
    and
    uses
    0
    for
    the
    hold
    check.
    
    "\fB<number_of_cycles>\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    number
    of
    cycles
    allowed
    for
    the
    path.
    
    "\fB-rise\fR"
    Applies
    the
    assertion
    at
    the
    rising
    edge
    of
    the
    signal
    on
    the
    path
    endpoints.
    
    "\fB-start
    |
    -end\fR"
    Specifies
    whether
    the
    multicycle
    adjustment
    is
    to
    be
    applied
    relative
    to
    the
    starting
    clock
    edge
    for
    the
    path
    or
    relative
    to
    the
    ending
    clock
    edge
    for
    the
    path.
    
    Use
    these
    options
    for
    multiple
    clocks
    designs.
    By
    default,
    the
    setup
    check
    is
    relative
    to
    the
    end
    clock
    and
    the
    hold
    check
    is
    relative
    to
    the
    start
    clock.
    
    Note:
    The
    -start
    and
    -end
    parameters
    are
    mutually
    exclusive;
    you
    cannot
    specify
    them
    together.
    
    You
    can
    set
    the
    timing_enable_sdc_compatible_data_check_mcp
    global
    variable
    to
    true
    to
    enable
    checking
    for
    SDC
    compatible
    data
    checks.
    When
    the
    -start
    parameter
    is
    specified,
    the
    parameter
    reverses
    the
    reference
    clock
    by
    one
    clock
    cycle.
    
    "\fB{-through | -rise_through | -fall_through}
    <through_list>\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    ports,
    pins,
    instances,
    or
    nets
    that
    the
    path
    goes
    through.
    
    The
    pins
    can
    be
    on
    intermediate
    hierarchical
    boundaries.
    The
    <through_list>
    variable
    can
    contain
    either
    collection
    IDs
    or
    object
    names.
    
    When
    used
    without
    the
    -from
    or
    -to
    option,
    all
    paths
    that
    go
    through
    the
    -through
    pins
    are
    multicycle
    paths.
    When
    used
    with
    both
    the
    -from
    and
    -to
    options,
    any
    path
    starting
    at
    any
    pin
    on

    -from
    list
    and
    going

    any
    point
    on
    the
    -through
    pin
    list
    and
    going
    to
    any
    point
    on
    the
    -to
    list
    is
    affected
    by
    the
    assertion.
    
    You
    can
    use
    only
    one
    -from
    and
    -to
    option,
    but
    you
    can
    specify
    several
    -through
    options
    in
    the
    same
    command.
    
    By
    default,
    the
    -through
    option
    applies
    the
    assertion
    to
    both
    the
    rising
    and
    the
    falling
    edges.
    Using
    the
    -rise_through
    option
    applies
    the
    assertion
    at
    the
    rising
    edge
    of
    the
    signal
    on
    the
    through
    pins.
    Using
    the
    -fall_through
    option
    applies
    the
    assertion
    at
    the
    falling
    edge
    of
    the
    signal
    on
    the
    through
    pins.
    
    "\fB{-to| -rise_to | -fall_to}

    defined.
    You
    can
    define
    a
    single
    operating
    condition
    from
    a
    library,
    and
    the
    software
    uses
    the
    PVT
    characteristics
    associated
    with
    that
    library
    for
    every
    library
    in
    the
    design.
    When
    you
    use
    this
    parameter
    in
    multiple
    set_op_cond
    commands,
    the
    software
    uses
    the
    value
    specified
    in
    the
    last
    command.
    If
    the
    -library
    parameter
    is
    not
    specified,
    the
    <opCond>
    in
    the
    first
    library
    read
    is
    used.
    
    For
    example,
    consider
    the
    following
    commands:
    
    set_op_cond
    WCCOM
    -library
    wcTestLib
    
    set_op_cond
    BCCOM
    -library
    bcTestLib
    
    set_op_cond
    WCCOM
    -library
    wcTestLib1
    
    set_op_cond
    BCCOM
    -library
    bctestLib1
    
    set_op_cond
    -library
    wcTestLib2
    
    set_op_cond
    -library
    bcTestLib2
    
    In
    this
    case,
    the
    software
    uses
    the
    last
    value
    defined
    (bcTestLib2).
    Therefore,
    the
    operating
    conditions
    in
    the
    bcTestLib2
    library
    are
    used
    for
    both
    setup
    and
    hold
    analysis.
    
    "\fB-max
    <maxOpCond>\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    operating
    condition
    normally
    used
    for
    setup
    analysis.
    
    "\fB-maxLibrary
    <maxLib>\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    library
    in
    which
    the
    <maxOpCond>
    is
    defined.
    If
    the
    
    
    -maxLibrary
    parameter
    is
    not
    specified
    and
    -max
    is
    used,
    the
    <maxOpCond>
    from
    the
    first
    library
    listed
    in
    the
    maximum
    libraries
    is
    used.
    
    "\fB-min
    <minOpCond>\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    operating
    condition
    normally
    used
    for
    hold
    analysis.
    
    "\fB-minLibrary
    <minLib>\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    library
    in
    which
    the
    <minOpCond>
    is
    defined.
    If
    the
    
    
    -minLibrary
    parameter
    is
    not
    specified
    and
    -min
    is
    used,
    the
    <minOpCond>
    from
    the
    first
    library
    listed
    in
    the
    minimum
    libraries
    is
    used.
    
    "\fB<opCond>\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    operating
    condition
    used
    for
    setup
    and
    hold
    analysis.
    
    You
    can
    specify
    a
    virtual
    operating
    condition
    created
    with
    the
    multi-mode
    multi-corner
    create_op_cond
    command.
    
    "\fB-powerDomain
    <domainName>\fR"
    Specifies
    that
    the
    <opCond>
    is
    used

    The
    timing
    system
    treats
    any
    arrival
    time
    exceeding
    the
    opening
    edge
    as
    negative
    slack.
    For
    hold
    checks,
    the
    timing
    system
    performs
    the
    checks
    with
    respect
    to
    the
    closing
    edge
    of
    the
    latch.

    Adds
    source
    and
    network
    latency
    of
    the
    specified
    reference
    pin
    to
    the
    output
    delay
    value
    in
    propagated
    mode.
    A
    reference
    pin
    is
    a
    leaf
    pin
    in
    the
    fanout
    cone
    of
    the

    issues
    a
    warning
    and
    accepts
    the
    first
    pin.
    
    You
    cannot
    use
    the
    -reference_pin
    parameter
    with
    the
    -network_latency_included

    "\fB-place_detail_allow_border_pin_abut

    Some
    libraries
    have
    cells
    with
    pin
    geometry
    that
    is
    not
    set
    back
    by
    half-routing
    pitch
    from
    the
    normal
    PR-boundary
    of
    that
    cell.
    In
    cases
    where
    the
    pin
    geometries
    touch
    the
    cell
    PR_boundary,
    placement
    of
    an
    instance
    of
    this
    cell
    can
    cause
    a
    DRV
    violation
    with
    a
    normal
    pin
    geometry
    of
    the
    other
    cells.
    To
    avoid
    these
    DRVs,
    placer
    will
    add
    one
    Site
    padding
    to
    the
    cell-side
    during
    pre-processing,
    thus
    satisfying
    the
    min-spacing
    rules.
    The
    -place_detail_allow_border_pin_abut
    option
    disables
    this
    pre-emptive
    DRV
    avoidance
    behavior,
    and
    no
    auto-padding
    is
    done
    when
    the

    is
    set

    true.
    
    Default:
    false
    
    "\fB-place_detail_check_route

    between
    FIXED

    wires
    and
    instance
    pins.
    When
    this

    refinePlace
    ignores

    Default:

    Note:
    Using
    this
    parameter
    might
    result
    in
    longer
    run
    time.
    
    If
    you
    specify
    refinePlace
    -place_detail_io_pin_blockage,
    you
    do
    not
    need
    to
    specify
    -place_detail_check_route
    for
    signal
    pins
    because
    refinePlace
    will
    treat
    the
    signal
    pins
    similar
    to
    supply
    pins
    for
    blockages.
    However,
    signal
    wires
    still
    need
    this
    parameter.

    }]  .P Specifies the amount of power for all or part of the
    design. This command is used to define user-specified power
    on cells and instances. You must specify this command before
    report_power. .P The set_power command can accept a cell/instance
    list using the get_cells/get_lib_cells commands. You can
    use the get* commands to create a collection of cells/instances
    whose name matches the supplied pattern list. Therefore,
    providing you with the flexibility in providing lists through
    use of regular filter patterns. This feature is supported
    in both static and dynamic analysis engines.  .SH Parameters
       "\fB-ascii_power_file<filename>\fR" Specifies the name
    of an instance list file. This file contains the list of
    instances in the following format: .P <instance_name> <power_value>
    <<pin_name>>   Here, .RS  "*" 2 <instance_name>is the instance
    name to which power is to be distributed.  "*" 2 <power_value>is
    the power value for the instance in watts.  "*" 2 <pin_name>
    is an optional argument to specify the pin name. When specified,
    allows you to assign power to the specific pin of the instance.
     "*" 2 The three fields should be in one line, and each instance
    should be in a new line. .RE   "\fB-cell <cell_name><value>\fR"
    Specifies the cell name. If the cell or instance name is
    not specified, the power will be distributed to all rails.
     If you want to specify power for a group of cells/instances,
    use the get_cells/get_lib_cells commands. The -cell parameter
    can accept these commands to create a collection of cells/instances
    whose name matches the supplied pattern list. For example,
    -cell[get_lib_cells NAND*] 2mw  "\fB-clock {all|<clock_name>}\fR"
    Specifies the power value for clock networks. You can specify
    the power value for a specific clock network or the clock
    network power value for the whole design.  Note: This parameter
    cannot be used with the -cell, -instance and -pg_net parameters.
     "\fB-custom_macro_pwl <filename>\fR" Specifies to use a
    custom trigger file to apply instance or cell PWL waveforms.
    Given one master cell PWL waveform, the software can automatically
    generate scaled PWL waveforms of the other companion cells
    defined in the trigger file proportional to the cell internal
    power.   Note: This parameter must be used with set_power
    -dynamic_switch_pattern in the vectorless flow.  For more
    information on the trigger file format, see triggerTrigger
    File Format.  "\fB-default_dynamic_pgv_mode { <mode_name>
    }\fR" Specifies the current characterization mode to be used
    during dynamic power and jitter analyses. This parameter
    can be specified when using a PGV with multiple functional
    modes. .P When this parameter is specified, the Power Calculation
    engine uses this preferred mode in scheduling the switching
    events for the macro blocks, and saves these events in the
    trigger file.   The use model of this parameter is:  set_power
     -cell {} | -instance {} -default_dynamic_pgv_mode { <mode_name>
    }  This parameter is mutually exclusive to the -dynamic_switch_pattern
    parameter. If a cell or instance has both the -dynamic_switch_pattern
    and -default_dynamic_pgv_mode parameters defined in the same
    Tcl script, -dynamic_switch_pattern takes higher priority.
     "\fB-dynamic_switch_pattern <pattern>\fR" Specifies stimulus
    pattern on the pins of an instance and cell. Specify this
    parameter only in the dynamic mode for the type instance
    and cell.  The <pattern> is applied to all pins (input and
    output) on the instance/cell. It is a string.  <pattern>
    specifies the switching pattern. If there is more than one
    clock domain with timing windows on a pin, only the windows
    on the fastest clock will be used, and the pattern will be
    applied to that clock period. It is a string of 0, 1, r,
    and f values. 0 for cycles not to switch and 1 for cycles
    to switch. r is for rise only and f for fall only.  The pattern
    string should include enough digits to cover all of the clock
    cycles in the simulation period. If there are not enough
    digits, the pattern will be padded with 0 values at the end.
    If there are too many, the pattern will be truncated to the
    number of applicable cycles. Transitions will be scheduled
    in the center of each applicable timing window.  Notes .RS
     "*" 2 0 and 1 is supported only in the probability-based
    vectorless flow. It is not supported in the state-propagation-based
    vectorless flow and the vector-based flow.  "*" 2 In case
    of macros, you can specify the mode names, that is, which
    mode switches in which clock cycle -dynamic_switch_pattern
    { mode1 - mode2 - }. .RE   You can specify - to indicate
    that instances will not switch in a particular clock cycle.
    If "-" is the first value in the string of values specified
    within {}, you must insert a space before "-", as shown below:
    .RS  "*" 2 no switching: -dynamic_switch_pattern { - - }
     "*" 2 no switching in the 1st clock period: -dynamic_switch_pattern
    { - r } .RE   Examples:  In the following example, instance
    will not switch in the 4th clock cycle:  set_power -dynamic_switch_pattern
    { f r f - r }  In the following example, the mode write will
    switch in the 1st clock cycle, the mode read will switch
    in the 2nd and 4th clock cycle, and none of the modes will
    switch in the 3rd clock cycle:  set_power -dynamic_switch_pattern
    { write read - read }  Note: You can use the wildcard ( *
    ) character for the -instance and -cell parameters to specify
    a pattern of instance/cell names to which the specified switching
    pattern is to be applied.  "\fB-exclude_clock\fR" Excludes
    clock networks when specifying a scale factor or power specification
    for the whole design.  This parameter cannot be used with
    the -cell, -instance and -pg_net parameters.  "\fB-force\fR"
    Specifies to apply the set_power command even if there are
    Verilog mismatches. For dynamic or DEF-based static analysis,
    this parameter allows you to apply  set_power to the DEF
    instances that do not exist in Verilog.   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs
    the command usage.  "\fB-internal\fR" Specifies the target
    internal power of the design, cell, or instance. To specify
    internal power for cells and instances, you can use the -internal
    parameter in conjunction with the -cell or -instance parameter.
     "\fB-instance <inst_list><value>\fR" Specifies the instance
    name. If the cell or instance name is not specified, the
    power will be distributed to all rails.  "\fB-leakage\fR"
    Specifies the target leakage power of the design, cell, instance,
    or power net.  To specify leakage power for cells and instances
    you can use -leakage option in conjunction with -cell or
    -instance option.  To specify leakage power of a certain
    power net in the design you can use -pg_net option along
    with -leakage option.  "\fB-no_propagation\fR" Specifies
    that the user-defined switch pattern is applied only after
    state-propagation is complete. The use model of the command
    parameter is:  set_power -dynamic_switch_pattern {<pattern>}
    -no_propagation  The -no_propagation parameter must be specified
    with the -dynamic_switch_pattern parameter. When the -no_propagation
    parameter is specified, the dynamic power engine performs
    state-propagation first, and then overrides the single instance
    switching event by the user-defined dynamic switch pattern
    without any further propagation.  "\fB-pg_net <railname>\fR"
    Optional. The specified power or pwl for the cell, instance
    or design is applied to the specified rail. When not specified,
    the power or pwl is applied to all the rails associated with
    the instance. This option is generally used for MSMV cells.
     When this option is not specified the behavior is different
    for pwl and power options. When not specified and power option
    is used, the power is applied for the whole design, cell,
    or instance. When not specified and pwl option is used, the
    pwl is applied to every rail of the cell or instance.  "\fB-pin
    <pin_name> <pin_power>\fR" Specifies pin-wise power numbers
    for a specific instance. This parameter allows you to control
    the power assigned to power ground pins of an instance. Following
    is the use model of this parameter: .P set_power -instance
    <<inst_name>> -pin <<VDDA>> <<pin_power>>  set_power -instance
    <<inst_name>> -pin <<VDDB>> <<pin_power>>   "\fB-pwl\fR"
    Specifies that power argument (power | pwl) is a waveform
    rather than a power number.  "\fB-repeat\fR" Repeats dynamic
    switch pattern of all the clock cycles in the simulation
    period.   "\fB-reset\fR" This parameter causes all previous
    set_power commands to be ignored.  Note: You can selectively
    reset the instance/cell specifications. In addition, you
    can also selectively reset the cell and instance specifications
    of a list of objects through the get_cells  and   get_lib_cells
    commands.  "\fB-scale_factor <value>\fR" Scales the power
    value by the specified scale factor. This parameter allows
    you to set a user-defined scale factor in the trigger file
    to scale the dynamic current of the PGV.  "\fB-static_mode
    { <custom_label_name> | <mode_name> }\fR" Specifies the mode
    name or the custom label name associated with a cell or instance
    for computing instance current from PGV with static multi-voltage
    multi-frequency (MvMf) modes. This current is used to compute
    the instance's internal power, and its switching and leakage
    power components would be set to zero.  The use model of
    this parameter is given below:  set_power -instance -static_mode
    READ  If you specify custom label of a static MvMf mode,
    currents would be taken from it directly. Alternatively,
    if only mode name is specified for a cell/instance, the software
    snaps to the nearest custom label defined within this mode,
    based on the instance's voltage and frequency to get the
    currents.  "\fB-sticky\fR" Applies the simulation based PWL
    waveform as is, to the specified cell/instance for dynamic
    power analysis.  Use this option only if you have specified
    -pwl.  "\fB-switching <value>\fR" Specifies the target switching
    power of the design, cell, or instance. To specify switching
    power for cells and instances, you can use the -switching
    parameter in conjunction with the -cell or -instance parameter.
     "\fB-trigger_time_adjustment <time>\fR" Specifies to adjust
    the trigger time of the current waveforms for the various
    functional modes (read/write/idle) of the custom macros.
    This parameter allows you to start the waveform before the
    trigger time (negative time support) to account for the setup
    time for the operation, as shown below:   (<Image> To view
    the image, refer to the Tempus Text Command Reference - Release
    20.2 manual.)   The specified time will be applied to the
    computed trigger time for each mode in the trigger files
    generated by power analysis. For example, if the trigger
    time (from timing window/vector) is computed as 1ns, 2ns,
    and 3ns, and if you specify set_power -trigger_time_adjustment
    -100ps, the software will adjust the trigger time to .9ns,
    1.9ns, and 2.9ns.  "\fB<value>\fR" Specifies power in milliwatts
    during static power calculation or piecewise linear (-pwl)
    current waveform, during dynamic power calculation for cell
    or instance. The command accepts a unit specification (e.g.
    10w).  The format of the PWL waveform is:  {<time1> <current1>
    <time2> <current2> ...<time_n> <current_n>}  Time is in ns
    and current in mA.  Example:  set_power -pwl -pg_net {} -cell
    BUFX2MTL {0 0 10 0 10.1 5 10.5 0}  Here, at 0ns its value
    is 0mA, at 10ns its value is 0mA, at 10.1ns its value is
    5mA, and so on.  .SH Examples .RS  "*" 2 The following command

     .P Sets the parameters for doing the power analysis. .P
    Parameters   "\fB-analysis_view<mmmc>_<view>  \fR" Specifies
    the power analysis library view (for MMMC setup). You can
    specify only one analysis view at a time.  Note:  You can
    also use -view instead of - analysis_view to specify the
    power analysis library view.  If report_power -view <view>
    is specified, this view will override -analysis_view setting.
     There is no default.  "\fB-average_rise_fall_cap {true |
    false}\fR" When set to true, the software uses the average
    of rise and fall capacitance from the liberty file.  Default
    : false  "\fB-binary_db_name  <filename>\fR" Specifies the
    name of the binary power database file (filename.db).  You
    can specify this parameter in scenarios where more than one
    db is generated and you need to track which one was generated
    in which mode when the restoring the db, or if your design
    has several blocks and analysis is done on one block all
    the time and all the databases are named power.db.  "\fB-bulk_pins
    {<bulk_pin_list>}\fR" Defines power and ground bulk LEF pins
    for the design.  Use this parameter when library cells have
    bulk pins defined in LEF but the liberty file does not contain
    power associated with these pins. If a liberty file does
    not have body bias definition, power analysis does not distribute
    power to the body bias domain.  Note: The -bulk_pins parameter
    cannot be reset using the set_power_analysis_mode -reset
    parameter.  "\fB-capacity {low|medium|high}\fR" Enables segmented
    power processing. When this parameter is specified, the software
    performs concurrent processing of vector simulation annotation,
    power calculation, and report construction.  This parameter
    enables performance optimization with some trade-off on memory
    consumption and runtime. The arguments of the -capacity parameter
    are: .RS  "*" 2 low - reduces memory for a flat run.  "*"
    2 medium - further reduces memory with moderate increase
    in runtime (1.2X).  "*" 2 high - maximum memory reduction
    at about 2X runtime. .RE   The -capacity parameter is used
    for reducing memory when processing long simulation vectors.
    In case of the FSDB and SHM format activity file, the runtime
    can increase up to 2X.  "\fB-clock_source_as_clock {true
    | false}\fR" Specifies to use the correct clock frequency
    for activity calculation. If you stop the arrival of the
    clock signal by setting set_case_analysis to 0, the transition
    density at the output net of the flop is calculated using
    the correct clock frequency instead of the default frequency.
     "\fB-constant_override {true | false}\fR" Specifies to give
    higher precedence to propagated constants defined using the
    set_case_analysis command. It allows propagated constants
    to override global activity.  "\fB-corner {min|max}    \fR"
    Defines the library corner (for non-MMMC setup). .RS  "*"
    2 min corner means power calculator will use min timing libraries
    for the power calculation. .RE .RS  "*" 2 max corner means
    power calculator will use max timing libraries for the power
    calculation. .RE   Default : max  "\fB-create_binary_db 
     {true | false}\fR" A value of true creates a binary database
    of power results.   Default : false  "\fB-create_driver_db{true
    | false}\fR" Specifies to determine all the drivers/receivers
    on the ground net.   "\fB-current_generation_method { avg
    | peak }\fR" Specifies the current waveform generation method
    during dynamic power analysis. The two possible arguments
    of this parameter are:  .RS  "*" 2 avg  - Specifies to use
    the average current value of each time step. The output current
    filename is <filename>.ptiavg. The default value is avg.
     "*" 2 peak - Specifies to use the peak current value of
    each time step. The output current filename is <filename>.ptipeak.
    It is recommended to use the peak method when using the Composite
    Current Source Power (CCSP) Liberty files. .RE   "\fB-default_frequency
    <value>\fR" Specifies to set the default frequency in the
    MHz unit for net not annotated by TWF. You can specify a
    numerical value without unit.   "\fB-default_slew <value>\fR"
    Specifies to set the default slew in the ns unit for net
    not annotated by TWF. You can specify a numerical value without
    unit.   "\fB-default_supply_voltage <value>\fR" Specifies
    to set a default voltage for power nets in a scenario where
    the power engine cannot determine the voltage of these nets.
    The default value of this parameter is 1.0.   "\fB-disable_clock_gate_clipping{true
    | false}  \fR" Specifies to enable clock gate output clipping
    so that the output transition density of an ICG cell does
    not exceed the input clock pin transition density.  Default
    : true        "\fB-disable_leakage_scaling{true | false}\fR"
    Specifies to exclude leakage power during scaling factor
    computation when target power is specified using the set_power
    command. When set_power_analysis_mode -disable_leakage_scaling
    is set to true, the leakage power does not get scaled, and
    only the internal and switching components are scaled to
    meet the user-specified total power.  This parameter is relevant
    only for the set_power commands for which total power is
    specified, and has no effect for the set_power command specified
    with the -internal, -switching, or -leakage parameters. 
    "\fB-disable_static {true | false}\fR" When set to true in
    the dynamic vector-based or dynamic vectorless flows, the
    command performs only dynamic analysis and turns-off static
    power calculation.  Default : true  Note: When you perform
    static power calculation in the dynamic power analysis flow,
    you can use either the -disable_static or -write_static_currents
    parameter to enable static power calculation and write static
    current file. If only -disable_static is set to false and
    -write_static_currents is not set, the tool automatically
    sets -write_static_currents to true. Similarly, if -write_static_currents
    is set to true, and -disable_static is not set, the tool
    automatically sets -disable_static to false.  "\fB-distributed_setup<file>\fR"
    Specifies a file containing the customized setup details
    for running power analysis in the distributed mode.   The
    specified file has 4 columns:  INST/CELL <<name>> hier/block
    <<power.inc>>  where, .RS  "*" 2 INST/CELL: Keyword indicating
    cell or instance to be run in the distributed mode. Cell
    can be useful for repeated DEF blocks.  "*" 2  name: Name
    of the hierarchical block or instance.  "*" 2  hier/block:
    Keyword indicating hierarchy or block. hier implies that
    the full hierarchy will be preserved by including the DEFs
    from top to the block, and block implies that only the lower
    level DEF will be included  "*" 2  power.inc: name of the
    power include file. This column is optional. .RE   The unspecified
    instance/cell will be run with the top level as a single
    group. Each distributed block/instance should have corresponding
    TWF and SPEF to improve runtime.  "\fB-decap_cell_list  <cell_list>\fR"
    Specifies the physical only cells, such as decap cells, to
    include in the power report.  Note:  This is only supported
    for Static Power Analysis.  "\fB-domain_based_clipping{true
    | false}  \fR" Determines the frequency to be used to clip
    propagated activity that is too high. When set to false,
    the frequency of the fastest clock in the design is used.
    If you set this parameter to true, the fastest clock domain
    on the net is used to clip propagated activity.  Default:
    false   "\fB-dynamic_glitch_filter<value>\fR" Sets the absolute
    threshold time (in ns) for filtering glitches in net toggles.
    When you specify a time value for this parameter, glitches
    in net toggles that are equal to or smaller in width than
    the specified time value are removed.  Default: -1  "\fB-dynamic_power_view
    <view_name>  \fR" Specifies a separate dynamic analysis view
    for power calculation.  You can set the -dynamic_power_view
    as the analysis view for dynamic, net, and total power calculation.
    If you do not specify this parameter, the 1st setup view
    will be assumed as dynamic view and will be used to calculate
    power.  Ensure that the specified views are well defined
    from both a Power and Timing point of view.  Note: You can
    specify the same or different views as the leakage and dynamic
    views for optimization and signoff. .RS  "*" 2 If the leakage
    and dynamic view is to be the same, then run the following
    command:  set_power_analysis_mode -leakage_power_view power_view_name
    -dynamic_power_view power_view_name  "*" 2 If the leakage
    and dynamic view is to be different, then run the following
    command:  set_power_analysis_mode -leakage_power_view leakage_view_name
    -dynamic_power_view dynamic_view_name .RE   For more information,
    refer to the Specifying the Correct Power Views for Optimization
    section in the Optimizing Timing chapter of Innovus User
    Guide.  "\fB-dynamic_vectorless_ranking_methods {load | clock
    | vector_activity}\fR" Specifies to change the ranking method
    from the default to the following: .RS  "*" 2 load - Prioritizes
    scheduling cells with higher fanout  "*" 2 clock - Prioritizes
    scheduling cells associated with faster clocks  "*" 2 vector_activity
    - Prioritizes scheduling cells with higher activity .RE 
     "\fB-enable_auto_mapping {true | false}\fR" Specifies to
    automatically perform instance name mapping between the RTL
    netlist and GATE level netlist. This parameter allows you
    to map the RTL vector to the Gate level netlist without a
    mapping file.  You can use this parameter with the read_activity_file
    -name_mapping_rule <<filename>> command parameter to specify
    a file containing customized or design-specific rules.  "\fB-enable_duty_prop_with_global
    {true | false}\fR" Specifies to propagate duty cycle with
    the global switching activity setting for all data nets in
    the dynamic vectorless analysis flow.   "\fB-enable_dynamic_scaling
    {true | false}\fR" Enables set_power scaling for dynamic
    power analysis. The power and scaling specifications are
    used to scale dynamic current on both the power and ground
    currents of the specified instance/cell.  This parameter
    honors the user-defined average (static) power for leaf-level
    instances and hierarchies (instances/cells/modules) along
    with power net specification in the dynamic current scaling
    flows such that the average of the dynamic current is equal
    to the assigned average power. When you specify this parameter,
    the average of the dynamic current of these leaf-level instances
    will match the scaled static power numbers.  Note: This parameter
    is not supported in the state-propagation-based vectorless
    flow (set_power_analysis_mode -enable_state_propagation true).
    It is applicable only to the probability-based vectorless
    flow.   Default: false  "\fB-enable_generated_clock {true
    | false}\fR" Specifies to get generated clock frequency during
    activity propagation for static power analysis. The default
    value of this parameter is true.  "\fB-enable_input_net_power
    {true | false}\fR" Specifies to calculate the switching power
    of input nets.  Default is false.  "\fB-enable_mt_in_vectorbasedflow
    {true | false}\fR" Specifies to enable multi-threading for
    the VCD/FSDB based dynamic vector-based flows.  Default is
    false. To enable multi-threading in the vector-based flows,
    set this parameter to true.  "\fB-enable_pba_for_tempus_pi
    {true | false}\fR" Specifies to enable the Path-Based Analysis
    (PBA) for slack calculation in the Tempus Power Integrity
    (Tempus PI) flow. By default, the Graph-Based Analysis (GBA)
    is used.  Default is false.  This parameter is only applicable
    to the state-propagation-based vectorless flow (set_power_analysis_mode
    -method dynamic_vectorless -enable_state_propagation true).
     "\fB-enable_rtl_vectorbased_dynamic_analysis {true | false}\fR"
    Specifies to take an RTL or partial VCD/FSDB file as input
    and use that for dynamic vector-based flow. This parameter
    allows you to estimate current even for instances which are
    missing from the activity file.  You must use this parameter
    in conjunction with the  -method dynamic_vectorbased parameter.
    Default is false.  "\fB-enable_scan_report {true | false}\fR"
    Specifies to generate all the scan mode analysis reports.
    The following reports will be generated: .RS  "*" 2 voltus_power.scanff.duplicated.rpt
    - flip-flops that are specified in multiple chains  "*" 2
    voltus_power.scanff.missing.rpt - flip-flops that are missing
    in the scan control file but exist in the design  "*" 2 voltus_power.scanff.nonassigned.rpt
    - flip-flops that do not exist in the design and are dropped
    from the scan control file  "*" 2 voltus_power.scanff.nonscan.rpt
    - assigned flip-flops that have no scan-out pin  "*" 2 voltus_power.scanff.nonswitched.rpt
    - non-switching flip-flops in the scan control file  "*"
    2 voltus_power.scanff.rpt - detailed scan chain report containing
    global statistics for all scan chains and statistics for
    each scan chain in the design  "*" 2 voltus_power.scanff.stateconflict.rpt
    - flip-flops that have conflicting state assignment .RE 
     Default : false  "\fB-enable_state_propagation {true | false}\fR"
    Specifies to enable the vectorless state-propagation-based
    dynamic analysis flow. Default is false. State-Propagation-Based
    Vectorless Methodology section in the "Dynamic Power and
    IRDrop Analysis" chapter of the Voltus User Guide.   "\fB-enable_tempus_pi
    {true | false}\fR" Specifies to enable the Tempus PI analysis
    flow. When this parameter is set to true, data path scheduling
    is timing-aware, that is, scheduling is based on timing slacks.
    Default is false.  This parameter is only applicable to the
    state-propagation-based vectorless flow (set_power_analysis_mode
    -method dynamic_vectorless -enable_state_propagation true).
     For more information, refer to the Tempus Power Integrity
    Analysis chapter in the Tempus User Guide.  "\fB-enable_xp
    {true | false}\fR" Specifies to run standalone report generation
    in the XP mode.  Default : false  "\fB-enhanced_blackbox_avg
    {true | false}\fR" Specifies to use the average toggle rate
    of related inputs for enhanced blackbox propagation.  Default
    : false  "\fB-enhanced_blackbox_max  {true | false}\fR" Specifies
    to use the maximum toggle rate of related inputs for enhanced
    blackbox propagation.  Default : false  "\fB-extraction_tech_file
    <filename>\fR" Specifies the extraction technology file to
    be used for top-level power-grid extraction.   "\fB-fanout_limit
    <value>\fR" Specifies the fanout limit for nets. If an instance
    has nets more than or equal to the fanout limit, its switching/internal/leakage
    power is taken to be zero.  "\fB-flatten_xpgv_block_instances<filename>\fR"
    Specifies a file that includes a list of block instances
    that use DEF instead of xPGV for power analysis, that is,
    specify the instances that are not to be used as xPGV. This
    parameter allows you to specify a few instances of the same
    block that will use DEF, and the others that will use xPGV
    at the top-level. If you do not specify this parameter, and
    if both DEF and xPGV are given for a block, xPGV takes precedence
    over DEF.  Instance List File Format:  INST|CELL  <<instance_name/cell_name>>
     <<block_instance_name>|All|None>   In this file, you can
    specify if a block is using a DEF by specifying the block
    instance name, or with the All or None keywords. All indicates
    that all instances are using DEF, and None indicates that
    none of the instances are using DEF.  Example:  INST instA
     /top/x1/x12/instA  For a design with three blocks, if you
    want to use the DEF and xPGV as following:  Block_1 - > A1
    (xPGV ) & A2 (DEF)  Block_2 - > B1 & B2 (xPGV for both instances)
     Block_3 - > C1 & C2 (DEF for both instances)  The specified
    file will contain the following information:  INST Block_1
    A2  INST Block_2 None  INST Block_3 All  "\fB-from_x_transition_factor
    <value>\fR" Specifies how transitions from X to 0/1 are counted.
    The default value is 0.5.   "\fB-from_z_transition_factor
    <value>\fR" Specifies how transitions from Z to 0/1 are counted.
    The default value is 0.25.   "\fB-generate_current_for_rail
    <railnames>\fR" Generates current files for the specified
    rail.  By default, the command generates current files for
    all power rails.  "\fB-generate_static_report_from_state_propagation
    {true | false}\fR" Specifies to directly generate the static
    power analysis result based on the RTL-VCD input and state-propagation.
    When this parameter is specified, the RTL vector power analysis
    flow does not require the generation of a TCF/FSDB file.
    This parameter is applicable only to the RTL vector-based
    dynamic power analysis flow.  Default : false     "\fB-handle_glitch
    {true | false}\fR" A transition is defined as a glitch when
    the time difference between two sequential toggles are less
    than half of the rise transition time + fall transition time
    in the vector-based static power calculation.  If set to
    true, glitch power will be identified and calculated according
    to this definition and it will be reported in a separate
    column. Switching or internal power calculation does not
    include power due to glitches.  If set to false, glitch power
    will not be identified, and the respective power will be
    calculated as normal signal switches. Hence, the total power
    will be a little higher.  Default : false   "\fB-handle_tri_state
    {false|true}\fR" When set to true, all tristate device enable
    pin values will be taken into account when determining the
    propagation of the activity through tristate gates.  Default
    : false  "\fB-hier_delimiter <character>\fR" Specifies the
    hierarchical delimiter in the DEF file. The default hierarchical
    delimiter is a forward slash (/) but can be changed by setting
    the -hier_delimiter parameter. You can use this parameter
    to override the existing hierarchical delimiter.   "\fB-honor_combinational_logic_on_clock_net
    {true | false}\fR" Specifies the behavior of combination
    logic on clock net. .RS  "*" 2 true (default) - specifies
    to honor activity propagation through combinational logic.
     "*" 2 false - specifies that the combination logic will
    be treated like a combinational clockgate. .RE   "\fB-honor_negative_energy
    {true | false}\fR" A value of true specifies that Voltus
    will keep negative internal energy numbers from the.lib internal
    power table. When set to false, negative power is treated
    as 0.  Default : true  "\fB-honor_net_activity {true | false}\fR"
    Specifies to use activity from the Net section of the Switching
    Activity Interchange Format (SAIF) file for power calculation
    and optimization, and to ignore the pin-based state-dependent
    path delay (SDPD) activity. The default value of this parameter
    is true.  When this parameter is set to false, the power
    calculation engine can use both the net-based and pin-based
    activity. In this case, precedence will be given to activity
    from net or pin that appears later in the SAIF file.  "\fB-ignore_control_signals
    {true | false}\fR" A value of true specifies that control
    signals will be ignored when propagating activity.  Default
    : true  "\fB-ignore_data_phase_for_clk {true | false}\fR"
    Specifies to ignore data frequency in the clock path for
    the clock instances in the design. When this parameter is
    set to true, the software propagates only the fastest clock
    pin frequency instead of the data pin frequency for activity
    propagation through clock network. The default value is 
    false. In the default mode, the software picks the fastest
    frequency between the data phase and clock phase on that
    pin.   "\fB-ignore_glitches_at_same_time_stamp{true | false}\fR"
    Specifies to ignore glitches at the same transient time in
    the vector-based static and dynamic power analysis flow.
    When -ignore_glitch_at_same_time_stamp is set to true, only
    the last signal value change is honored, and all the preceding
    value changes at the same time stamp are ignored. The last
    signal value will overwrite the previous value for the same
    signal at the same time stamp, so the last value will represent
    the state of the signal at that time stamp.  Default : false
     "\fB-ignore_inout_pin_cap {true | false}\fR" When set to
    true, ignores the bidirectional pin capacitances (direction
    : inout) defined for I/O cells in the .lib file, when calculating
    switching power and internal power; this also includes the
    default capacitance value for inout pins.  Default : false
     "\fB-ignore_end_toggles_in_profile {true | false}\fR" By
    default, the software profiles the toggles in the user-selected
    vector time window by steps including the toggles at the
    start/end boundary of the window. In each step, the toggles
    on the start boundary edge of the step is counted in the
    current step; the toggles on the end boundary edge is counted
    in the next step.  When this parameter is set to false, the
    toggles on the end boundary edge is also counted in the last
    step, as there is no next step to it. This may lead to double
    count of the power profile for the last step, especially
    for zero-delay vector profiling. The default of this parameter
    is false.  When this parameter is set to true, the software
    ignores the toggle on the end boundary of the last step.
     "\fB-include_seq_clockpin_power  {true | false}\fR" Reports
    the clock pin power of flip-flops as part of the clock network
    power.  Default : false  "\fB-ir_derated_timing_view <view_name>\fR"
    Specifies the name of the timing view used to calculate timing
    slack and to rank the flops in the Tempus PI flow. This parameter
    must be specified if there are multiple views.  The -ir_derated_timing_view
    parameter defines the timing view used to detect the IR-sensitive
    paths using a lower voltage than the actual analysis. This
    lower voltage simulates the IR-drop for each instance in
    the design. The software uses this view to prioritize the
    end-points that need to be prioritized for switching.  This
    parameter is only applicable to the state-propagation-based
    vectorless flow (set_power_analysis_mode -method dynamic_vectorless
    -enable_state_propagation true).  "\fB-leakage_power_view
    <view_name>  \fR" Specifies a separate leakage analysis view
    for power calculation.  You can set the -leakage_power_view
    as the analysis view for leakage power calculation. If you
    do not specify this parameter, the 1st setup view will be
    assumed as leakage view and will be used to calculate power.
     The leakage view can be inactive only if -state_dependent_leakage
    is set to false. Ensure that the specified views are well
    defined from both a Power and Timing point of view.  Note:
    You can specify the same or different views as the leakage
    and dynamic views for optimization and signoff. .RS  "*"
    2 If the leakage and dynamic view is to be the same, then
    run the following command:  set_power_analysis_mode -leakage_power_view
    power_view_name -dynamic_power_view power_view_name  "*"
    2 If the leakage and dynamic view is to be different, then
    run the following command:  set_power_analysis_mode -leakage_power_view
    leakage_view_name -dynamic_power_view dynamic_view_name .RE
      For more information, refer to the Specifying the Correct
    Power Views for Optimization section in the Optimizing Timing
    chapter of Innovus User Guide.  "\fB-leakage_scale_factor_for_temp
    <scale>\fR" Performs a linear scaling of the leakage power
    for temperature in all libraries. This replaces the k-factor
    for temperature in the .lib file. For process and voltage,
    the scaling will continue to be based on the corresponding
    k-factors in the .lib file. A value of 0.8 scales the leakage
    power in the library to 80 percent. A value of 1.2 scales
    the leakage power in the library to 120 percent.  Default
    : 1  "\fB-library_preference {voltage | ecsm_ccsp}\fR" Instances
    of the same cell can be attached to different power domains
    in a design. If you have specified different PVT libraries,
    then the software will by default bind each instance to the
    closest library definition.  You can use this parameter to
    select either the closest Effective Current Source Model
    (ECSM)/Composite Current Source-power (CCSP), or the closest
    voltage library for the instance: .RS  "*" 2 voltage: when
    specified, enables library binding to the closest voltage
    library.  "*" 2 ecsm_ccsp: when specified, enables library
    binding to the closest ECSM/CCSP library. .RE   The default
    is voltage.  "\fB-mbff_toggle_behavior { simultaneous | independent
    | sbff }\fR" Specifies the toggle behavior of multi-bit flip-flops
    (MBFF). The possible arguments are: .RS  "*" 2 simultaneous:
    The multiple bits of the MBFF will toggle or not toggle at
    the same time. The MBFF will be considered as one flip-flop.
     "*" 2 independent: The multiple bits of the MBFF will toggle
    independently. The MBFF will be considered as one flip-flop.
     "*" 2 sbff: The MBFF will be considered as multiple Single-Bit
    Flip-Flops (SBFFs). Each bit will be considered as one flip-flop,
    and will toggle independently. .RE   The default value is
    independent.  "\fB-merge_switched_net_currents { true | false}\fR"
    Specifies to merge switched net currents into always-on currents.
    For designs with a large number of switched nets, this parameter
    helps improve performance by merging switched net instance
    currents with always-on instance currents. However, when
    this parameter is set to true, you will not be able to use
    the generated current files to run power-up analysis.  Default
    : false   "\fB-method {  static | dynamic_vectorless | dynamic_vectorbased
    |  dynamic_mixed_mode }\fR" Specifies the type of analysis
    to be performed. You can perform two types of power analysis,
    namely static and dynamic. .RS  "*" 2 static - specifies
    to perform static power analysis to calculate average power.
    .RE   Dynamic power analysis can be a vector-based or vectorless
    approach. .RS  "*" 2 dynamic_vectorbased - uses the full
    VCD output of a logic simulator to identify the instances
    that are switching and when they switch.  "*" 2 dynamic_vectorless
    - uses the timing arrival window information from a static
    timing analysis tool to determine when instances switch.
    A timing arrival window describes when a signal can change
    within a clock cycle. An additional algorithm then determines
    the instances that switch.  "*" 2  dynamic_mixed_mode - specifies
    to combine the vector-based and vectorless (mixed) dynamic
    analysis. This flow can be used in the following cases: .RS
     "*" 2 case 1: vectors are not available for every block
    of a full-chip design.   In this case, the software uses
    the vectorless methodology for blocks with incomplete vectors
     "*" 2  case 2: blocks with vectors having unannotated combinational/
    sequential logic.   In this case, the software performs state
    propagation for the missing combinational/ sequential logic.
    It uses the vectorless methodology for a logic cone that
    does not have the primary inputs or flops annotated from
    the vector, and then performs state propagation  To enable
    the dynamic mixed mode analysis flow, you must specify the
    following commands:  set_default_switching_activity -clock_gates_output
    2.0 -global_activity <activity>  set_power_analysis_mode
    -method dynamic_mixed_mode  read_activity_file -scope <>
    -block <> -> (for available blocks) .RE  .RE   Default :
    static  "\fB-min_leaf_count <value>\fR" Specifies the minimum
    number of leaf instances required for writing the hierarchy
    data in the profiling database. It allows you to restrict
    the number of hierarchies for which waveforms are reported
    in the profiling database when using both the -write_profiling_db
    and  report_power -hierarchy parameters.  The default value
    of this parameter is 0. Any hierarchy whose leaf instance
    count in its complete sub-tree is less than the -min_leaf_count
    value will be skipped from getting reported in the profiling
    database. This parameter can be used to skip very small hierarchies
    and as a result save on the database writing time and disk
    space.  "\fB-off_pg_nets <net>_list  \fR" The name of the
    power rails that will be turned off. The net name can contain
    instance hierarchy if appropriate. This data will be taken
     into account when figuring out the list of power gates which
    are switched off.  Note:  A net is turned off if all connected
    power gates are turned off by control signals. When a net
    is off, all of the instances connected to the net will only
    contribute leakage current into the connecting nets.  "\fB-output_current_data_prefix
    <prefix>\fR" Specifies a prefix to the static or dynamic
    current files generated by the software. When power analysis
    is done in the multi-CPU mode, the output current data directory
    name and the underlying current files will also use the same
    prefix by default.  "\fB-partition_twf {true | false}\fR"
    Specifies to read the input TWF data (flat or hierarchical
    TWF files), and generate block-level TWFs.    The default
    is false. This parameter must be specified when the block/partition
    level TWF files are not available.  "\fB-pin_based_twf {true
    | false}\fR" Specifies whether to generate pin-based TWF
    or net-based TWF. The default value is false. .RS  "*" 2
    When set to false, a net-based TWF file is generated. Net-based
    TWF file is smaller in size and therefore results in faster
    processing.  "*" 2 When set to true, a pin-based TWF file
    is generated. Pin-based TWF file is bigger in size and requires
    longer processing time, however, is more accurate because
    the slews numbers are pin-based. .RE   Note: This parameter
    must be used with the read_sdc command.  "\fB-power_grid_library
     { <library_list> }\fR" Specifies the name of the Cadence
    power cell libraries (.cl). You can also specify a list of
    defined power-grid libraries having decap cells tagged in
    them.  Note: When specifying a list of PGVs to power analysis
    using the set_power_analysis_mode command, you must specify
    the technology library as the first PGV library in the list,
    followed by the standard and macro PGV libraries. The selection
    between the standard and macro PGV library is order based.
    Therefore, if multiple power-grid libraries are specified
    for a cell, the power engine maps the cell with the first
    library after the technology library.  "\fB-power_include_initial_x_transitions
    {true | false}\fR" Controls how the initial X state toggle
    should be counted. The initial X state means the state at
    time 0.  The default value is true. This means that the software
    counts the power caused by the X->0 or X->1 toggle. When
    set to false, the software does not count the power caused
    by the initial X state toggle.  "\fB-power_match_state_for_logic_x
     <value>\fR" Controls how the logic X will be evaluated in
    the boolean function of the 'when' state of a power table.
    The default value is 0.  The parameter uses the following
    arguments: .RS  "*" 2 0 - regards X as 0 .RE .RS  "*" 2 1
    - regards X as 1 .RE .RS  "*" 2 x/X - regards X as neither
    0 nor 1, that is, whenever there is any X logic in it, the
    boolean function will be evaluated false. .RE   "\fB-precision
    <value>  \fR" Specifies precision of decimal range [1-8]
    to ensure consistent decimal places are displayed for each
    power component. The default value is 8. This parameter is
    used for precision handling in report_instance_power and
    report_power.  "\fB-quit_on_activity_coverage_threshold <threshold_value>\fR"
    Specifies the activity (VCD/FSDB/TCF) coverage threshold
    value. This parameter allows you to control the acceptable
    activity coverage that you are expecting and enforce the
    software to quit when it does not meet the criteria. When
    you specify the threshold value, the software exits if the
    real activity coverage is below the threshold.  "\fB-read_rcdb
    {true | false}\fR" Specifies to write a SPEF file containing
    only the total C for signal nets and pass it to the Dynamic
    Power engine. Dynamic power analysis requires only the total
    C for signal nets. Therefore, instead of writing a large
    SPEF file (with distributed RC) from the RCDB, this parameter
    specifies to create and pass a SPEF file with only total
    C for all the signal nets. This significantly reduces the
    parasitic annotation time in the Dynamic Power engine.  Default
    : false  "\fB-report_black_boxes {true | false}\fR" Specify
    this parameter to report cells that are used as black boxes.
     A black box is a cell which is either missing from the liberty
    file or has no functionality defined in the liberty file.
     Default : false  This is an optional parameter.  "\fB-report_idle_instances
    {true | false}\fR" Specifies to generate a report (idleinstance.rpt)
    that lists all the idle or non-switching instances.  The
    default value is false.  The following is a snippet of the
    idleinstance.rpt report:  DFF22/DFF    F  DFF42/DFF    F
     ...  Here, the first column is the instance name and the
    second column is the type of instance (F indicates flop and
    C indicates combinational).  "\fB-report_instance_switching_info
    {all | output_logic | none}\fR" Specifies to generate a report
    for combinational instance switched during state-propagation.
    In the output file, it contains the toggle time, instance
    name, input pin event, and output pin event for each switching
    event of the combination gate. The possible arguments of
    this parameter are: .RS  "*" 2 all - Specifies to report
    instance toggle information for both input and output pins.
    When this parameter is set to all, the switching of both
    the input and output pins of all the instances are reported
    in the voltus_power.stateprop.switchinst file and the switching
    of flops are reported in the voltus_power.stateprop.switchsrc
    file.  "*" 2 output_logic - Specifies to report instance
    toggle information for the output pins only. When this parameter
    is set to output_logic, the switching of the output pins
    of all the instances are reported in the voltus_power.stateprop.switchinst
    file and the switching of flops are reported in the voltus_power.stateprop.switchsrc
    file.  "*" 2 none - Disables generation of instance toggle
    report. This is the default option. When this parameter is
    set to none, only switching of flops are reported in the
    voltus_power.stateprop.switchsrc file. The file does not
    report switching of instances. .RE   The default value is
    none. This parameter is used for generating switching details
    of state-propagation and should be specified only for debugging
    purpose.  The following is a snippet of the voltus_power.stateprop.switchinst
    report:  *------------------------------------------------

    Specifies to generate a report (voltus_power.stateprop.switchlist)
    containing all the switching times for the specified instances
    when the -enable_state_propagation parameter is set to true.

    Specifies to report library usage statistics in a text report.
    The report contains information such as, cell name, library
    format used (CCSP/ECSM/NLPM) for each cell, library name,
    and so on. This parameter allows you to perform library integrity
    checking for debugging purpose.  Default : false  The format

    {true | false}\fR" Specifies to report missing bulk pins
    in the missing input report (-report_missing_input).   "\fB-report_missing_input
    {true | false}\fR" Specifies to report missing netlist information
    in input files, such as library, LEF/DEF, PGV, SPEF, TWF,
    and missing logical connectivity for cell instance (PGNET).
     The name of the report file is: <<prefix>>_missingdata.<spef|lefdef|lib|pgv|twf|pgnet>

    true   report_power -output <dirname> -report_prefix <prefix>
       "\fB-report_missing_nets { true|false }  \fR" Controls
    reporting of missing nets in both static and dynamic power
    analysis.    This parameter controls reporting for TWF and
    activity files in static analysis, and controls reporting
    for TWF/SDC/SPEF and activity files in dynamic analysis.
     Default : false    "\fB-report_scan_chain_stats {true |

    during scan mode analysis that contains scan chain statistics.
       The default value is false.  The report has 2 parts: .RS

    attribute report based on the TWF attributes that are specified
    using the set_twf_attribute command.  The possible arguments
    are: .RS  "*" 2 summary - generates a summarized static timing
    analysis report voltus_power.twf_attribute.summary that displays
    the number of user-defined TWF attributes (delay, slew, and
    slack values for both the rise and fall transitions) and
    the number of annotated TWF attributes for dynamic power
    analysis. The following is a snippet of the report:  (<Image>

    summary  "\fB-reset\fR" Resets all or specified parameters
    to their default values.  When you specify only the -reset
    parameter, the software resets all parameters for the set_power_analysis_mode
    command.  When resetting specific parameters, the -reset
    parameter must be the first followed by the specific parameter.
    For example, you can specify the following command to reset
    only the -method parameter while keeping all other parameters'
    values unchanged:  set_power_analysis_mode -reset -method
     Note:  When resetting a specific parameter, you must not
    specify any arguments for that parameter.  "\fB-scale_to_sdc_clock_frequency
    {true | false}\fR" Specifies to enable the VCD clock frequency
    to be scaled up to the SDC clock frequency. This allows you
    to match the VCD clock to the SDC clock to run analysis.
    By default, the clock frequency is scaled based on the activity
    file (Default: false). When you set the -scale_to_sdc_clock_frequency
    parameter to true, the power report and current waveforms
    apply the after-scaled clock frequency.  The default behavior
    for clock frequency scaling in the RTL and Gate level VCD
    flows is different, as described below: .RS  "*" 2 RTL VCD
    - By default, the clock frequency is scaled to the SDC clock
    frequency (-scale_to_sdc_clock_frequency true) when the RTL
    VCD flow is enabled (set_power_analysis_mode -enable_rtl_vectorbased_dynamic_analysis
    true).   You can disable clock frequency scaling by setting
    the set_power_analysis_mode -scale_to_sdc_clock_frequency
    parameter to false.  "*" 2 Gate VCD - By default, scaling
    of the clock frequency is disabled (-scale_to_sdc_clock_frequency
    false) .   You can enable the VCD clock frequency to be scaled
    up to the SDC clock frequency by setting the set_power_analysis_mode
    -scale_to_sdc_clock_frequency parameter to true. This works
    only when set_power_analysis_mode -use_zero_delay_vector_file
    is set to true, which means that the gate VCD is a zero-delay
    gate VCD. .RE   "\fB-scan_chain_name {<design_name> <chain_name>
    <pattern>}\fR" Specifies to automatically generate a scan-chain
    control file from a scan-chain based DEF file for the shift
    mode scan-chain analysis. This parameter allows you to create
    a control file for a large-sized DEF containing long chains
    or for multiple-DEF files. The generated scan-chain control
    file is saved in the power output directory.  The use model
    of the parameter is: .RS  "*" 2 -scan_chain_name {all pattern}
    - generate scan control file for all scan chains.  Example:
    -scan_chain_name {all 11010}  "*" 2 -scan_chain_name {design_name
     chain_name  pattern} - generate scan control file for a
    specific chain.  Example: -scan_chain_name{counter AutoChain_1_seg1_clk_rising
    10010} .RE   Using this parameter, you can generate the control
    file for both flat and hierarchical DEFs.  "\fB-scan_control_file
    <filename>  \fR" Specifies the scan control file name required
    to run the Scan Mode Analysis flow.  The scan control file
    contains details about the scan analysis mode used for testing.
    For more information, refer to scan_fileScan Control File
    Format.  "\fB-scan_mbff_chain_type <type>\fR" Specifies the
    type of multi-bit scan flip-flop. .RS  "*" 2 liberty - specifies
    to use the syntax in Liberty to decide the multi-bit flip-flop
    type.  "*" 2 serial - specifies to pick the first flop as
    the starting flop, and treat the scan chain as serial, regardless
    of .lib.  "*" 2 parallel - specifies to treat the scan chain
    as parallel, regardless of .lib. .RE   "\fB-settling_buffer
    <value>\fR" Specifies the settling buffer time (in ps unit)
    between multiple windows of a VCD file. This parameter is
    used when you specify multiple pairs of the start time and
    end time for the non-overlapping multiple windows specified
    in an activity file (using the read_activity_file command).
     Multiple current waveforms representing multiple VCD windows
    are merged into a single continuous current waveform. To
    capture the waveform for signals at the edge of user windows,
    a buffer time is added between the windows being stitched.
    This buffer time ensures that the stitched waveform is contiguous.
    The generated waveform hence has the duration of user windows
    and the intervening settling buffers. The default settling
    buffer period is 400ps. You must specify the buffer value
    without unit.  The following is an example of this feature:
     set_power_analysis_mode -verbosity true \\      -settling_buffer
    200 -report_missing_nets true  read_activity_file \\    
     -format  VCD -scope  adder/u1 \\      -start  {0ps 2000ps}

     "\fB-split_bus_power {true | false}\fR" A value of false
    applies the internal power number to each individual bit.
     A value of true divides the internal power number by bus
    width, before applying it to the bus bit.  Default : false
     "\fB-state_dependent_leakage {true | false}\fR" When set
    to false, power analysis performs state independent leakage
    power calculation.  Default : true  "\fB-static_multimode_scenario_file
    <filename>\fR" Specifies a file with information on instance
    scaling scenario for the static multi-mode IR analysis flow.
    When this parameter is specified, Power Analysis creates
    the multi-mode static current file that is used during rail
    analysis. The format of the input file is:  INST_NAME   
       PIN_NAME        SCALE_FACTOR_1       .....   SCALE_FACTOR_N
     Here, the first column indicates the macro instance name,
    the second column indicates the pin name, followed by multiple
    current scaling factors. Each column of the scaling factor
    is referred to as a scenario. You must specify positive values
    only for scale factors.  The following is a snippet from
    the specified input file:  top/macroA     VDD     1     0.5
        0.5     1  top/macroA     VDDM    0.5   0.5     0.5 
       1  top/macroB     VDD     0.5   1       0.5     0.5  If
    scale factors are not specified for certain scenarios, the
    tool will automatically use the instance's last stored scale
    factor value to complete current file generation.  In the
    following example, scale factor value 0.45 will be used in
    the 3rd and 4th scenario for instanceC, and scale factor
    value 0.35 will be used in the 4th scenario for instanceD:
     instanceA VDD 0.45 0.55 0.65 0.31  instanceB VDD 0.31 0.5
    0.67 0.21  instanceC VDD 0.25 0.45  instanceD VDD 0.31 0.25
    0.35  "\fB-static_netlist {verilog | def}\fR" Specifies to
    perform static power analysis using a Verilog or DEF only
    neltist.   By default, the static power analysis is performed
    using the Verilog netlist as the primary netlist. Using this
    parameter, you can specify DEF when a DEF netlist with logical
    connectivity is available, and use it as primary and not
    consider the Verilog netlist.  This parameter is also enabled
    when set_rail_analysis_mode -report_power_in_parallel is
    true for static power computation.  Default : verilog  "\fB-start_time_alignment
    {true |false}\fR" Specifies to align all the signals of the
    activity file at time zero. When set to true, the simulation
    period is max(endtime - starttime). When it is false, the
    simulation period is max(endtime)-  min(startime).  Default
    : true  Note:  This parameter is not supported in the vector
    profiling flow. In the vector profiling flow, the start time
    will always be the min(starttime) and the end time will always
    be max(endtime).  "\fB-thermal_input_file <file>  \fR" Specifies
    to read a power map file to perform thermal analysis. Thermal
    input file contains die area divided into tiles, and temperature
    value for each tile. This temperature of each tile is used
    to calculate power of all the instances that fall in that
    tile's bounding box.  The format of the thermal input file
    is:  DIE_TEMPERATURE_MAP    DIE_AREA   xmin(um) ymin(um)

    instance  "*" 2 LAYER specifies the LEF layer name  "*" 2
    XCOOR and YCOOR are the coordinates of each tile  "*" 2 T0(0,0)
    .... is the temperature value assigned to a tile at a specific
    coordinate .RE   "\fB-to_x_transition_factor <value>\fR"
    Specifies how 0/1 to X transitions are counted. The default
    value is 0.5.   "\fB-to_z_transition_factor <value>\fR" Specifies
    how 0/1 to Z transitions are counted. The default value is
    0.25.   "\fB-transition_time_method {min | avg | max}\fR"
    Specifies the minimum, maximum, or average transition time
    method that will be used with the integrated timer or the
    external TWF.  Default : max  "\fB-twf_delay_annotation {min
    | avg | max}\fR" Allows you to choose between min, max, or
    avg arrival times from the timing window file (TWF). The
    arrival time is annotated to the vectors processed from the
    RTL VCD/FSDB Zero-Delay flows. The default value is avg.
      "\fB-twf_load_cap {min | avg | max}\fR" Allows you to select
    minimum, maximum, or average value of TWF external load or
    capacitance for power calculation.  Default : max       
          "\fB-use_cell_leakage_power_density {true | false}\fR"
    Specifies to use library leakage density times area (default_leakage_power_density),
    if defined, instead of the library's default cell leakage
    power (default_cell_leakage_power). This is used when leakage
    power for cells are missing or not defined.  The default
    value of this parameter is true.  "\fB-use_fastest_clock_for_dynamic_scheduling
    {true | false}\fR" Specifies to use only the respective fastest
    clock associated with each net or pin to schedule events
    for a given simulation period.  The default value of this
    parameter is false.   "\fB-use_lef_for_missing_cells {true
    | false}\fR" Allows a combination of LEF and PGV in the dynamic
    analysis flow. The default value of this parameter is false.
     If there are cells that are common to LEF and PGV, the PGV
    cell will get the precedence.  "\fB-use_zero_delay_vector_file
    {true | false}\fR" Enables zero delay mode in vector-based
    dynamic analysis to avoid pessimism in current estimation.
    When set to true, the software reads the cycle accurate (zero
    delay) VCD/FSDB file and adds the timing/delay information
    from the Timing Analyzer or external TWF file to the VCD/FSDB
    file.  Default: false  "\fB-vector_profile_mode {activity
    | event_based | power_density | transient}\fR" Specifies
    the method used to perform vector profiling. The possible
    arguments are: .RS  "*" 2 activity - performs activity profiling.
    This parameter generates only the worst activity report,
    and does not generate the average power report. The name
    of the file is as specified using the report_power -outfile
    parameter.  "*" 2 event_based - generates the average power
    report. This is the average power of all events in the user-specified
    window. This report includes a summary based on the power
    components, cell type, power rail, and clock network. The
    worst window report is captured in a file specified with
    the report_power -outfile parameter, and the report is suffixed
    by '.avgpower'. When -outfile is not specified, the vectorprofile.report.avgpower
    report file is created.  "*" 2 power_density - performs area
    or power density profiling. For this method, power is reported
    for each tile of the design, where design can be considered
    to be physically divided into equal area tiles. By default,
    a design is divided in 10x10 tiles.  "*" 2 transient - generates
    the event-based average power report and current files for
    the worst power window. .RE   This parameter must be specified
    with the -method vector_profile parameter.  Default: event_based
     "\fB-worst_case_vector_activity{true | false}\fR" Specifies
    to use the worst activity value when multiple vectors are
    specified in the static power calculation flow. The default
    value is false.   "\fB-worst_step_size <value>\fR" Specifies
    the step size or resolution for vector profiling. Activity/
    Power profiling is carried out for every step size that you
    specify.  When this parameter is used with -worst_window_size,
    the specified step size is the resolution at which window
    sliding is performed. The supported time units are s, ms,
    us, ns, and ps. If no explicit time unit is specified, the
    default ns will be applied.  "\fB-worst_window_count <value>\fR"
    Specifies the number of worst windows from the last vector
    profile run to be used for dynamic power analysis. It provides
    n top windows with maximum activity/power/IR. This parameter
    is used when you need to combine dynamic power analysis and
    vector profiling for multiple worst-case windows in a single
    run.  Default: 1 (implements single worst window)  "\fB-worst_window_size
    <value>\fR" Specifies the duration of dynamic analysis. This
    parameter is used for sliding window vector profiling that
    involves sliding the profiling windows by using a very small
    resolution value to get the window with the worst current
    profile. -worst_window_size must be specified with -worst_step_size.
     The supported time units are s, ms, us, ns, and ps. If no
    explicit time unit is specified, the default ns will be applied.
     "\fB-worst_window_type { power | activity | delta_power
    | delta_activity | ir | critical_inst_power }\fR" Specifies
    the window type to be used for multi-window analysis. The
    possible arguments are: .RS  "*" 2 power - worst instance
    power  "*" 2 activity - worst instance activity  "*" 2 delta_power
    - worst dp/dt (rate of change of power)  "*" 2 delta_activity
    - worst da/dt (rate of change of activity)  "*" 2 ir - worst
    IR  "*" 2 critical_inst_power - worst power for critical/IR-sensitive
    instance (worst timing and IR) .RE   Default: power  "\fB-write_default_uti
    {true | false}\fR" For instances that are not hooked to any
    power/ground rail, the current for these instances are reflected
    in the default static current files: .RS  "*" 2 static_default_ground_rail.ptiavg
     "*" 2 static_default_power_rail.ptiavg .RE   Default: true
     "\fB-write_profiling_db {true | false}\fR" Writes out profiling
    databases which can later be viewed as histograms using the
    SimVision interface. You can specify this parameter during
    both the activity and power vector profiling.  The profiling
    databases support instance level and power/ground net histograms.
    It creates an output file name with the *.trn extension.
     Default : false   "\fB-write_static_currents {true | false}\fR"
    A value of true tells Voltus to generate the current data
    files per net.  Default : false   Note:  When you perform
    static power calculation in the dynamic power analysis flow,
    you can use either the -disable_static or -write_static_currents
    parameter to enable static power calculation and write static
    current file. If only -disable_static is set to false and
    -write_static_currents is not set, the tool automatically
    sets -write_static_currents to true. Similarly, if -write_static_currents
    is set to true, and -disable_static is not set, the tool
    automatically sets -disable_static to false.  "\fB-x_transition_factor
     <value>\fR" When using VCD/FSDB, one can specify how transitions
    to and from X are counted. These transitions are defined
    as shown in Table 18-1. Transitions to and from the X state
    will be treated as full transitions multiplied by the specified
    factor.  Note:  0 -> X -> 1 or 1 -> X -> 0 count as full
    transitions and they are not controlled by the parameter.
     Default : 0.5  "\fB-z_transition_factor <value>\fR" When
    using VCD/FSDB, one can specify how transitions to and from
    Z are counted. These transitions are defined as shown in
    Table 18-1. Transitions to and from the Z state will be treated
    as full transitions multiplied by the specified factor. 
    Note:  0 -> XZ-> 1 or 1 -> Z-> 0 count as full transitions
    and they are not controlled by the parameter.  Default :
    0.25  "\fB-zero_delay_vector_toggle_shift <value>\fR" Specifies
    to shift the current waveform in the zero-delay VCD flow.
    This parameter is useful in removing the idle period for
    the current waveform result with a long idle period (small
    flat current) before the first high current peak because
    of delay annotation. The parameter allows to offset the idle
    period from the delay values. .P The use model is given below:
     set_power_analysis_mode -zero_delay_vector_toggle_shift
    -3.0ns   The default value is 0ns. The supported time units
    are s, ms, us, ns, and ps. The default unit is ns. You can
    specify a negative or a positive value. A positive value
    means right shift in the timeline or add more delay to the
    original arrival time, and a negative value means left shift
    in the timeline or trim the unwanted idle period.  The -zero_delay_vector_toggle_shift
    parameter enables you to make a more realistic current waveform
    that can be easily aligned with the other current waveforms.Note:
    This parameter is similar to the set_twf_attribute -shift_arrival_time
    parameter, with the only difference that  -zero_delay_vector_toggle_shift
    supports both positive and negative values while  -shift_arrival_time
    supports only a positive value. .P  Table 18-1  Transitions

    latency
    into
    account.
    Instead,
    the
    software
    calculates
    the
    network
    latency,
    which
    changes
    the

    removes the SI impact on a stage if the impact is less than
    the specified threshold. The threshold value is specified
    in seconds.  Default: -1  By default, the software uses the
    -delta_delay_threshold settings. If you set the -clock_delta_delay_threshold
    parameter, then it will be used for the clock nets.  When
    a threshold value using -delta_delay_threshold parameter
    is specified (and the default value of -clock_delta_delay_threshold
    parameter is used), then Tempus will use the -delta_delay_threshold
    value for both data and clock.  If you define values for
    both -delta_delay_threshold and -clock_delta_delay_threshold
    parameters, then Tempus will use the user-defined settings
    for data and clock, respectively.  "\fB-delay_only {true
    | false}\fR" Performs noise-on-delay analysis exclusively.
    This means that when you use this parameter, the software
    does not perform glitch analysis and only performs noise-on-delay
    analysis. In addition, this parameter performs SI analysis.
     To enable glitch noise, you can use the -enable_glitch_report
    parameter or run the update_glitch command.  Note that -delay_only
    cannot be used with -enable_glitch_report.  Default: false
     "\fB-enable_bus_attacker_correlation {true | false}\fR"
    Enables the software to treat bits of bus as correlated attackers.
     When set to true, the bits of bus type nets are grouped
    together based on their cumulative weight.  The bus bits
    that act as attackers to a specific victim are treated as
    a group. All the attackers are grouped into different bundles
    where normal (non-bus) attackers form one group and bits
    of the same bus form multiple other groups. In case of a
    victim that has a number of small couplings to bits of a
    bus, the combined effect of a full bus can be used to decide
    whether an attacker is significant.  Default: false  "\fB-enable_double_clocking_check
    {true | false}\fR" Enables double clocking check in AAE.
     This option enables double clocking analysis and report_double_clocking
    command can be run to print a report.  Default: false  "\fB-enable_delay_report
    {true | false}\fR" Enables SI delay reports.  For generating
    SI delay report, use the following:  set_si_mode -enable_delay_report
    true;   report_noise -delay max -txtfile max_delay.txt; 
     report_noise -delay min -txtfile min_delay.txt  To run report_noise
    -delay, you need to set this parameter prior to update_timing.
     Default: false  "\fB-enable_drv_with_delta_slew {true |
    false}\fR" When set to true, the max_transition violations
    are reported based on the SI slews. Also, this parameter
    is mandatory to allow SI slew reporting/fixing by the eco_opt_designeco_opt_design
    command and should be applied prior running the write_eco_opt_db
    command.  Default: false  "\fB-enable_dynamic_receiver_peak_limits
    {true | false}\fR" Enables automatic computation of ROP threshold
    value of two-stage cells, using the CCS-noise data on timing
    arcs.  When set to true, the software computes the noise
    threshold of the last stage from the table of DC currents.
     Default: false  "\fB-enable_logical_correlation {true |
    false}\fR" Enables the AAE-SI logical correlation. Logical
    correlation refers to correlation of logic between (aggressor)
    nets which are connected to each other. A simple case would
    be input and output nets of an invertor never switch in the
    same direction, so cannot be attackers to the same net simultaneously.
     Default: false  Note: You can use this parameter for Glitch
    Analysis also.  "\fB-enable_glitch_propagation {true | false}\fR"
    Enables glitch propagation through single stage cells and
    driver weakening through single stage and dual stage cells.
    When this attribute is set to true, the software does not
    delete the glitch waveform saved on instance input pins.
    The waveform is later used by spice deck to propagate glitch
    at the next stage receiver pin.  Default: false  Note: The
    software does not support glitch propagation for multi stage
    cells.  "\fB-enable_glitch_propagation_spice_deck {true |
    false}\fR" Enables the driver input glitch waveform to be
    printed in the SPICE deck such that SPICE can also perform
    single stage glitch propagation. When this option is set
    to true, the software does not delete the glitch waveform
    saved on instance input pins. The waveform is later used
    by spice deck to propagate glitch at the next stage receiver
    pin.  Default: false  "\fB-enable_glitch_report {true | false}\fR"
    Enables AAE SI glitch analysis.  For generating glitch report,
    use the following:  set_si_mode -enable_glitch_report true;
      report_noise -txtfile glitch.txt  Note that you cannot
    use -enable_glitch_report with -delay_only because the -delay_only
    option does not perform glitch analysis, and as a result
    no glitch is reported.  Default: false  "\fB-enable_overshoot_undershoot_glitch
    {true | false}\fR" Enables overshoot/undershoot analysis
    and reporting.  The life span of transistors can be described
    by the overshoot and undershoot values. If a transistor is
    consistently exposed to a certain percentage of overshoot/undershoot,
    then it may suffer a reduced life span.  Default: false 
    "\fB-enable_two_stage_driver_weakening  {true | false}\fR"
    Enables the two-stage driver weakening mode.  A non-failing
    significant glitch at the input of a two-stage driver can
    propagate through the first stage and weaken the second stage.
    This might cause the crosstalk-induced glitch to amplify
    at the next stage receiver (though it may not be significant
    enough to propagate). When two-stage driver weakening is
    enabled, the software considers weakened holding resistance
    for the two-stage driver for glitch analysis.  The following
    diagram illustrates two-stage driver weakening:  (<Image>
    To view the image, refer to the Tempus Text Command Reference
    - Release 20.2 manual.)   The dual stage driver weakening
    honors the glitch propagation threshold criteria.  Note:
    This feature is supported with CCS-N models only.  Default:
    true  "\fB-enable_virtual_attacker_constituent_report {true
    | false}\fR" Enables virtual attacker constituent reporting.
     The virtual attacker constituent reporting feature is useful
    for identifying significant buses and their bits - this information
    can be used for glitch fixing.   This feature is enabled
    when the set_si_mode -enable_bus_attacker_correlation parameter
    is set to true.  "\fB-hold_slack <<double>>\fR" Specifies
    the slack reselection threshold for hold.  Default:-1e-12
    seconds  "\fB-individual_attacker_clock_threshold <float>\fR"
    Sets the glitch tolerance for individual attacker nets on
    victim clock nets. Tempus estimates the noise contributed
    by an individual attacker on the clock victim. If the peak
    of this noise exceeds the value of individual_attacker_clock_threshold,
    the attacker is significant and is individually reported
    in the constituents section of the report. Otherwise, this
    aggressor becomes eligible for the virtual attacker. If the
    virtual attacker peak does not exceed the value of accumulated_small_attacker_threshold,
    the aggressor nets in the virtual attacker are grounded and
    there is no virtual attacker. If individual_attacker_clock_threshold
    is not specified then clock nets will use the individual_attacker_threshold
    value instead.  Note: Minimum allowed individual attacker
    for clock nets to be kept is 0.1% of vdd, which is equivalent
    to an individual_attacker_clock_threshold of 0.001.  Default:
    1.5% or 0.015  "\fB-individual_attacker_threshold <<double>>\fR"
    Sets the glitch tolerance for individual attacker nets on
    the victim net. Tempus estimates the noise contributed by
    an individual attacker on the victim. If the peak of this
    noise exceeds the value of individual_attacker_threshold,
    the attacker is significant and is individually reported
    in the constituents section of the report. Otherwise, this
    aggressor becomes eligible for the virtual attacker. If the
    virtual attacker peak does not exceed the value of accumulated_small_attacker_threshold,
    the aggressor nets in the virtual attacker are grounded and
    there is no virtual attacker.  Note: Minimum allowed individual
    attacker to be kept is 0.1% of vdd, which is equivalent to
    an individual_attacker_threshold of 0.001.  Default: 1.5%
    or 0.015  "\fB-individual_attacker_simulation_filtering 
     {true | false}\fR" Uses electrical filtering  to reduce
    pessimism due to small attackers being preserved when their
    simulated value is under the individual attacker threshold
    value.  Default: true  Note: This option can only be used
    when the accumulated small attacker is turned off (-accumulated_small_attacker_threshold
    is 1.00 or larger).  "\fB-input_glitch_threshold <<double>>\fR"
    Specifies the input glitch failure threshold value during
    AAE analysis.  Default: 0.4  "\fB-input_glitch_vh_threshold
    <<double>>\fR" Specifies the input glitch vh failure threshold
    value during AAE analysis.  Default: 0.4  "\fB-input_glitch_vl_threshold
    <<double>>\fR" Specifies the input glitch vl failure threshold
    value during AAE analysis.  Default: 0.4  "\fB-nonlinear_attacker_slew
    {true | false}\fR" Uses a non-linear attacker. If set to
    false, it uses a linear attacker.  Default: true  "\fB-num_si_iteration
    value\fR" Specifies the maximum number of timing window iterations
    that should be performed during SI delay analysis. Performing
    delay analysis results in changes to the timing windows,
    which can potentially change the victim/attacker net combinations.
    Timing window iterations enable the software to reach to
    a point where the delay changes are negligible.  Default:
    2  Note: The minimum allowed timing window iterations is
    2 for performing SI analysis.  "\fB-receiver_clk_peak_limit
    <double>\fR" Defines the glitch check limit for clock inputs
    in receiver peak mode. This parameter is specified as the
    percentage of power net voltage.  Default : 0.05 (5 percent
    of VDD)  "\fB-receiver_latch_peak_limit <double>\fR" Defines
    the glitch check limit for latch inputs in receiver peak
    mode. This parameter is specified as a ratio of vdd.  Default
    : 0.1 (10 percent of VDD)  "\fB-receiver_peak_limit <double>\fR"
    Defines the receiver peak/glitch peak limit at all nodes.
    The value specified for this parameter is a ratio of vdd.
      Default: 0.15     "\fB-report_max_virtual_attacker_constituents
    <int>\fR" Specifies the maximum number of virtual attacker
    constituents to report.  This feature works only when bus
    virtual attacker constituent reporting is enabled using the
    set_si_mode -enable_virtual_attacker_constituent_report true
    setting.  Default: 5  "\fB-secondary_attacker_decoupling_factor
    <double>\fR" Specifies decoupling factor for secondary aggressors.
     Default: 1  "\fB-separate_delta_delay_on_data {true | false}\fR"
    Separates the delta delay on data (delta delay is always
    separated for clock).  Works with  -delta_delay_annotation_mode
    to determine where the separated delay shows in the timing
    reports. Default is the delta delay, which is not separated
    out.  Using this parameter, you can increase runtime/memory.
     Default: false  "\fB-setup_slack <double>\fR" Specifies
    the slack reselection threshold for setup.  Default:-1e-12
    seconds  "\fB-si_reselection {delta_delay | slack}\fR" Specifies
    the SI reselection criteria during timing window iterations.
     delta_delay: Reselects a net for calculation if the delta
    delay on the net is greater than the delay value.  slack:
    Reselects nets that have failing slacks during timing window
    iterations.  Default: slack  "\fB-si_reselection_delay_threshold
    <double>\fR" Allows you to change the delay reselection criteria.
     You can specify   -si_reselection_delay_threshold with the
    -delta_delay parameter only.  Default: 1e-11  Units in seconds
     "\fB-skip_noise_model_check <pins>\fR" Specifies a list
    of pins for which noise model check will not take place.
     Default= " "  "\fB-skip_tw <nets>\fR" Specifies the list
    of nets for which timing window is to be skipped. The timing
    window becomes infinite for the net when it is both a victim
    and aggressor.  When specified, only the last setting is
    retained. The set_si_mode -skip_tw command settings, prior
    to the previous setting, are ignored.  Default: " "  "\fB-switch_prob
    <double>\fR" Sets the attacker switching probability. If
    you specify a value less than 0.0 or more than 1.0, the switching
    probability is automatically set to the default value of
    0.3.  Default: 0.3  "\fB-use_infinite_TW {true | false}\fR"
    Uses infinite timing windows in a single SI run.  Default:
    false  "\fB-unconstrained_net_use_inf_tw {true | false}\fR"
    Specifies that unconstrained nets will have an infinite timing
    window. To turn this off and use a constrained timing window,
    set this to false.  Default: true  .SH Examples .RS  "*"

    Default:
    -no_frame_fix_width
    
    Note:
    The

    the
    left
    for
    that
    particular
    table.
    
    "\fB-major_sort
    <integer>\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    column
    to
    be
    used
    in
    the
    major
    sort.
    If
    the
    column
    number
    is
    negative,
    it
    reverses
    the
    sort.
    
    "\fB-max_widths
    <list_of_integers>\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    maximum
    width
    for
    each
    table
    column
    in
    the
    report
    specified
    by
    the
    -name
    parameter.
    
    Note:
    You
    cannot
    specify
    -max_widths
    parameter
    without
    -name.
    
    You
    can
    separate
    each
    specified
    width
    value
    with
    a
    comma
    (,).
    For
    example,
    if
    you
    specify:
    
    -max_widths
    {10,20,30}
    
    The
    first
    column
    will
    have
    a
    maximum
    width
    of
    10,
    the
    second
    column
    will
    have
    a
    maximum
    width
    of
    20,
    and
    the
    third
    column
    will
    have
    a
    maximum
    width
    of
    30.
    The
    fourth
    and
    fifth
    columns
    will
    remain
    the
    default
    width
    spacing.
    
    Commas
    are
    also
    specified
    as
    column
    "placeholders",
    when
    you
    want
    to
    change
    the
    spacing
    of
    a
    column
    without
    changing
    the
    spacing
    of
    the
    preceding
    column.
    For
    example,
    if
    you
    specify:
    
    -max_widths
    {,,20,30}
    
    The
    third
    column
    will
    have
    a
    maximum
    width
    of
    20,
    the
    fourth
    column
    will
    have
    a
    maximum
    width
    of
    30,
    and
    the
    first,
    second,
    and
    fifth
    columns
    will
    remain
    the
    default
    width
    spacing.
    
    If
    you
    specify:
    
    -max_widths
    {20,,30}
    
    The
    first
    column
    will
    have
    a
    maximum
    width
    of
    20,
    the
    third
    column
    will
    have
    a
    maximum
    width
    of
    30,
    and
    the
    second,
    fourth
    and
    fifth
    columns
    will
    remain
    the
    default
    width
    spacing.
    
    Each
    column
    resizes
    itself
    to
    be
    between
    the
    range
    of
    the
    maximum
    and
    minimum
    widths
    specified
    for
    that
    column,
    based
    on
    the
    data
    in
    that
    column.
    Overruns
    are
    wrapped
    within
    the
    same
    column,
    unless
    otherwise
    specified.
    
    Default:
    {50,50,50,50,50}
    
    "\fB-min_widths
    <list_of_integers>\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    minimum
    width
    for
    each
    table
    column
    in
    the
    report
    specified
    by
    the
    -name
    parameter.
    
    Note:
    You
    cannot
    specify
    -min_widths
    parameter
    without
    -name.
    
    You
    can
    separate
    each
    specified
    width
    value
    with
    a
    comma
    (,).
    For
    example,
    if
    you
    specify
    -min_widths
    {7,10,15},
    the
    first
    column
    will
    have
    a
    minimum
    width
    of
    7,
    the
    second
    column
    will
    have
    a
    minimum
    width
    of
    10,
    and
    the
    third
    column
    will
    have
    a
    minimum
    width
    of
    15.
    The
    fourth
    and
    fifth
    columns
    will
    remain
    the
    default
    width
    spacing.
    
    Commas
    are
    also
    specified
    as
    column
    "placeholders",
    when
    you
    want
    to
    change
    the
    spacing
    of
    a
    column
    without
    changing
    the
    spacing
    of
    the
    preceding
    column.
    For
    example,
    if
    you
    specify
    -min_width
    {,,10,15},
    the
    third
    column
    will
    have
    a
    minimum
    width
    of
    10,
    the
    fourth
    column
    will
    have
    a
    minimum
    width
    of
    15,
    and
    the
    first,
    second,
    and
    fifth
    columns
    will
    remain
    the
    default
    width
    spacing.
    
    If
    you
    specify
    -min_width
    {7,,10},
    the
    first
    column
    will
    have
    a
    minimum
    width
    of
    7,
    the
    third
    column
    will
    have
    a
    width
    of
    10,
    and
    the
    second,
    fourth
    and
    fifth
    columns
    will
    remain
    the
    default
    width
    spacing.
    
    Each
    column
    resizes
    itself
    to
    be
    between
    the
    range
    of
    the
    maximum
    and
    minimum
    widths
    specified
    for
    that
    column,
    based
    on
    the
    data
    in
    that
    column.
    Overruns
    are
    wrapped
    within
    the
    same
    column,
    unless
    otherwise
    specified.
    
    Default:
    {5,5,5,5,5}
    
    "\fB-minor_sort
    <integer>\fR"
    Specifies
    the
    column
    to
    be
    used
    in
    the
    minor
    sort.
    It
    applies
    to
    all
    rows
    that
    have
    the
    same
    values
    in
    the
    major_sort
    column.
    If
    the
    column
    number
    is
    negative,
    the
    software
    reverses
    the
    sort.
    
    "\fB-name
    <string>\fR"
    Changes
    the
    formatting
    for
    the
    specified
    table.
    See

    you
    can
    use,
    and
    the
    commands
    with
    which
    they
    work.
    
    This
    parameter
    should
    only
    be
    used
    for
    -max_width
    or
    -min_width
    options.
    
    "\fB-no_frame_fix_width\fR"
    Specifies
    that
    the
    table
    columns
    have
    a
    fixed
    minimum
    width,
    but
    no
    maximum
    width
    (the
    data
    does
    not
    wrap).
    Column
    data
    that
    fits
    within
    the
    column's
    minimum
    width
    will
    left-justify
    and
    pad
    its
    location
    to
    fill
    the
    specified
    column
    space.
    
    Column
    data
    that
    is
    longer
    than
    the
    column's
    minimum
    width
    will
    take
    as
    much
    space
    in
    the
    table
    as
    needed.
    If
    a
    column
    is
    overwritten
    by
    the
    data
    from
    the
    preceding
    column,
    its
    data
    will
    begin
    on
    a
    new
    line
    at
    the
    correct
    column
    location.
    This
    is
    the
    default
    format
    for
    tables.
    
    "\fB-nosplit\fR"
    Specifies
    that
    each
    column
    follows
    the
    preceding
    column
    without
    splitting
    to
    a
    new
    line,
    if
    the
    data
    in
    one
    column
    overruns
    the
    next
    column.
    The
    wrapping
    behavior
    for
    data
    is
    controlled
    by
    the
    size
    of
    the
    display
    window.
    
    This
    format
    is
    useful
    for
    machine
    parsing
    the
    report.
    
    Note:
    You
    must
    specify
    -no_frame_fix_width
    in
    order
    to
    use
    this
    parameter.
    
    "\fB-reverse_rows\fR"
    Reverses
    the
    data
    rows.
    This
    is
    useful,
    for
    example,
    if
    you
    want
    to
    trace
    back
    from
    an
    end
    point
    and
    the
    default
    report
    traces
    forward
    from
    the
    end
    point.

    -delay_corner
    parameter
    instead.
    
    "\fB-mean\fR"
    Controls
    nominal
    derating.
    You
    can
    apply
    separate
    derating
    to
    the
    mean
    components
    of
    the
    delay.
    
    
    "\fB-multiply\fR"
    Incrementally
    multiplies
    derates.
    You
    can
    also
    apply

    to
    which
    the
    derating
    will
    be
    applied.
    
    "\fB-power_domain\fR"
    Allows
    you
    to
    specify
    a
    specific
    power
    domain
    for
    the
    timing
    derate
    factors
    to
    be
    applied.
    
    "\fB-pulse_width_check\fR"
    Specifies
    derate
    values
    for
    pulse
    width
    checks.
    
    Note:
    The
    -pulse_width_check
    and
    -clock_period_check
    parameters
    are
    mutually
    exclusive.
    
    To
    apply
    check
    derating
    to
    pulse
    width
    checks,
    set
    the
    timing_enable_derating_for_pulsewidth_checks
    global
    variable
    to
    true.
    By
    default,
    the
    global
    is
    set
    to
    false.
    
    "\fB-retain_delay
    \fR"
    Specifies
    scaling
    on
    retain
    constructs.
    If
    you
    specify
    both
    -retain_delay
    and
    -cell_delay
    parameters,
    the
    software
    uses
    the
    retain_delay
    value
    for
    retain
    construct
    scaling.
    If
    you
    do
    not
    specify
    the
    -retain_delay
    parameter,
    retain
    constructs
    are
    scaled
    in
    the
    same
    manner
    as
    cell
    delays.
    
    "\fB-rise\fR"
    Applies
    the
    derating
    factor
    to
    rising
    delay
    and
    check
    arcs
    based
    on
    the
    transition
    direction
    at
    the
    arc's
    sink
    pin.
    
    This
    parameter
    can
    be
    used
    to
    selectively
    apply
    timing
    derates
    for
    the
    rise
    arcs
    (cell,
    net,
    or
    check
    arcs).
    
    "\fB-sigma\fR"
    Controls
    derating
    on
    the
    variation
    component.
    You
    can
    apply
    separate
    derating
    to
    the
    sigma
    components
    of
    the
    delay.
    
    
    "\fB-static\fR"
    Applies
    the
    specified
    derating
    factor
    to
    the
    non-delta
    portion
    of
    net
    delays
    only.
    
    You
    can
    specify
    -net_delay
    or
    -cell_delay
    parameter
    with
    the
    -static
    parameter.
    
    You
    cannot
    specify
    -static
    with
    -mean
    or
    -sigma
    parameters.
    
    "\fB-statistical\fR"
    Applies
    derating
    on
    cells
    or
    nets
    that
    are
    modeled
    as
    statistical
    data
    elements.
    The
    specified
    derating
    factor
    is
    applied
    to
    both
    the
    mean
    and
    sigma
    of
    delays.
    
    If
    both
    the
    set_timing_derate
    -corner
    and
    -statistical
    options
    are
    not
    specified,
    the
    derating
    factor
    is
    equally
    applied
    on
    variation
    and
    corner
    objects.
    This
    is
    equivalent
    to
    issuing
    to
    two
    separate
    set_timing_derate
    commands,
    one
    with
    the
    -statistical
    option
    and
    the
    other
    with
    -corner
    option.

    s,
    ms,
    us,
    ns,
    and
    ps.
    The
    default
    unit
    is
    ns.
    You
    must
    specify
    a
    positive
    value
    only.
    A
    positive
    value
    means
    shift
    right
    in
    the
    time
    line
    or
    add
    more
    delay
    to
    the
    original
    arrival
    time.
    
    You
    can
    specify
    the
    -clock
    parameter
    to
    limit
    the
    changes
    to
    a
    clock
    domain.
    In
    addition,
    you
    can
    further
    add
    the
    -pin/-net
    parameter
    to
    limit
    the
    changes
    to
    a
    block.
    The
    following
    are
    examples
    of
    shifting
    different
    delays
    to
    different
    clock
    domains
    because
    different
    clocks
    may
    have
    different
    clock
    insertion
    delays
    at
    the
    top
    level:
    
    set_twf_attribute
    -shift_arrival_time
    1.2ns
    -clock
    clk_a
    
    set_twf_attribute
    -shift_arrival_time
    2.3ns
    -clock
    clk_b
    
    If
    a
    clock
    domain
    is
    not
    specified,
    the
    delay
    will
    be
    applied
    to
    all
    the
    specified
    nets/pins.
    
    Note:
    The
    final

    for
    the

    the

    .logv
    files.
    If
    three
    arguments
    are
    given,
    such
    as
    -log
    "a
    b
    c",
    then
    the
    three
    names
    are
    used
    exactly
    without
    any
    extension
    added.
    So,
    -log
    "mylog
    mycmd
    mylogv"
    will
    result
    in
    mylog
    mycmd
    mylogv
    files.
    
    
    The
    default
    for
    <prefix>
    is
    tempus.
    So
    if
    -log
    is
    not
    specified,
    tempus.log,
    tempus.cmd,
    and
    tempus.logv
    files
    will
    be
    created.
    If
    you
    specify
    -log
    test,
    the
    tool
    creates
    test.log,
    test.cmd
    and
    test.logv
    files.
    
    The
    .log
    file
    contains
    the
    normal
    logging
    output,
    the
    .cmd
    file
    contains
    the
    Tcl
    commands
    that
    were
    executed,
    and
    the
    .logv
    file
    contains
    a
    super-set
    of
    the
    .log
    output
    plus
    "verbose"
    debugging
    output
    that
    is
    needed
    only
    for
    detailed
    debugging.
    
    If
    the
    .log
    file
    already
    exists,
    an
    integer
    is
    added
    to
    the
    end
    of
    all
    the
    files
    to
    make
    them
    unique.
    This
    means
    if
    -log
    test
    is
    specified,
    the
    tool
    will
    create
    test.log
    test.cmd
    test.logv
    for
    the
    first
    run,
    test.log1
    test.cmd1
    test.logv1
    for
    the
    next
    run,
    and
    so
    on.
    Only
    the
    existence
    of
    .log
    is
    checked,
    the
    existence
    of
    the
    .cmd
    or
    .logv
    files
    is
    not
    checked.
    The
    -overwrite
    option
    can
    be
    used
    to
    disable
    this
    behavior
    and
    overwrite
    an
    existing
    .log
    file.
    
    If
    the
    prefix
    has
    a
    period
    in
    it,
    the
    last
    extension
    is
    stripped
    off
    for
    the
    .cmd
    and
    .logv
    usage.
    For
    example,
    -log
    out.log
    will
    result
    in
    out.log
    out.cmd
    out.logv
    files,
    and
    -log
    out.a.log
    will
    result
    in
    out.a.log
    out.a.cmd
    out.a.logv
    files.
    
    You
    can
    disable
    any
    given
    file
    by
    using
    /dev/null.
    For
    example,
    -log
    "my.log
    /dev/null
    /dev/null"
    will
    only
    create
    my.log.
    
    Default:

    necessary
    to
    update
    the
    timing
    analysis
    information.
    
    Note
    that
    for
    full
    SI
    accuracy
    during
    reporting,
    an
    explicit
    update_timing
    -full
    command
    is
    required
    after
    incrementally
    applying
    constraints
    such
    as,
    set_timing_derate,
    set_input_delay,
    set_max_delay,
    set_clock_groups,
    or
    create_clock
    (these
    constraints
    only
    affect
    SI
    delay
    calculation).
    
    Note:
    It
    is
    not
    required
    to
    run
    the
    update_timing
    command
    without
    the
    -full
    parameter
    because
    timing
    is
    automatically
    updated
    by
    the
    report_timing
    and
    report_constraint
    commands
    -
    except
    after
    incrementally
    applying
    constraints
    that
    only
    affect
    SI
    delay
    calculation.

    Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-abstracted_model\fR"
    Writes out the gate-level simulation (GLS) SDF file.   "\fB-adjust_setuphold_for_zero_hold_slack\fR"
    Adjusts the hold timing check to meet non-negative slack
    values.   "\fB-base_delay\fR" Writes out base delay information
    in the SDF file.  "\fB-celltiming {all | none | nochecks}\fR"
    Specifies which cell delays and timing checks to write out.
      Default: all .RS  "*" 2 all - Writes all cell delays and
    timing checks to the SDF file. This is the default. .RE .RS
     "*" 2 nochecks - Disables the writing of timing checks only.
    .RE .RS  "*" 2 none - Prevents cell delays and timing checks
    from being written into the SDF file. .RE   "\fB-collapse_internal_pins\fR"
    Collapses arcs across internal pins to a single primary input
    to primary output arc.  Use the -collapse_internal_pins parameter
    when the SDF file being generated is intended for use by
    an application that does not support the same internal pin
    structure in its leaf cell libraries (for example, Cadence
    VXL and NCsim Verilog simulation products). Do not use this
    parameter to generate an SDF file intended for use within
    the Tempus flow, or by third party tools that utilize the
    same Liberty timing models.  Default: Arcs between internal
    pins in a timing model are written to the SDF file as explicit
    annotations to and from the internal pins.  (<Image> To view
    the image, refer to the Tempus Text Command Reference - Release
    20.2 manual.)    For example, assume the following arc between
    internal pins:  The following SDF would be generated by default:(U1/in1
    U1/IntPinA (1::1) (1::1))   (U1/IntPinA U1/IntPinB (2::2)
    (2::2))   (U1/IntPinB U1/out1 (3::3) (3::3))   If you specify
    -collapse_internal_pins, the resulting SDF would show a single
    arc with the merged delays: (U1/in1 U1/out1 (6::6) (6::6))
     "\fB-condelse\fR" Writes CONDELSE constructs with the default
    value when a COND construct is written.  Note: Use this argument
    with the -version 3.0 option.  "\fB-delimiter <char>\fR"
    Specifies the hierarchy divider character to use in the output
    file. This option sets the hierarchy divider of only the
    write_sdf command. If omitted, the default hierarchy divider
    character (/) is used as the write_sdf default.  "\fB-delta_delay\fR"
    Writes out delta delay values to the SDF file.   "\fB-edges
    {edged | library | noedge | check_edge}\fR" Specifies the
    edges values. Refer to tableTable for full qualifications
    of the possible values for the edges option.   Default: edged
    .RS  "*" 2 check_edge - Keeps edge specifiers on timing check
    arcs but does not add edge specifiers on delay arcs. .RE
    .RS  "*" 2 edged - Keeps edge specifiers on timing check
    arcs and delay arcs. .RE .RS  "*" 2 library - Assumes that
    the <sdf_edges>attributes are specified in the .lib file.
    The default <sdf_edges>value of a timing arc is noedge. .RE
    .RS  "*" 2 noedge - Does not keep  edge specifiers.  .RE
      "\fB-exclude_cells\fR" Specifies a list of leaf-cell or
    hierarchical instances whose timing data will be excluded
    from the the SDF (Standard Delay Format) file. If you specify
    a hierarchical instance, the timing data for all leaf-cells
    below the level of hierarchy will be omitted from the SDF
    file.  "\fB-exclude_cells_keep_io_nets \fR" Restricts the
    filtering to just the annotations which are completely enclosed
    by the cell. Annotations to or from the cell will be preserved.
     By default, when the -exclude_cells parameter is used, any
    annotations within the excluded cell and any annotations
    to or from the excluded cell are filtered from the SDF. 
    "\fB-exclude_cells_keep_top_level_nets\fR" Allows you to
    configure the handling of top-level interconnect annotations
    to an instance that is excluded from the SDF using the write_sdf
    -exclude_cells parameter.   When this parameter is specified,
    the interconnect arcs which span to the ports of the instance
    will be included in the SDF. By default, no interconnect
    arcs to the instance are included. The delay annotated will
    be the worst-case delays of the top-level nets to/from the
    first level sink/source pins within the block that traverse
    a given input/output port of the instance, respectively.
      "\fB-exclude_disabled_arcs\fR" Excludes user set disabled
    arcs in the Standard Delay Format (SDF) file. If the user
    sets this option, the disabled arcs set by commands set_mode,
    set_disable_timing, and set_case_analysis are excluded. 
    "\fB-exclude_disabled_modes\fR" Excludes timing arcs that
    have been disabled due to an active library mode set by the
    set_mode command, from appearing in the SDF file.  "\fB-exclude_whatif_arcs\fR"
    Excludes what-if arcs in the SDF file.  "\fB<filename>\fR"
    Specifies the name of the SDF output file.  "\fB-filter \fR"
    Converts all negative interconnect and IOPATH delays to zero.
     "\fB-ideal_clock_network\fR" Marks delays of delay arcs,
    that are on the ideal clock networks, as 0 in the SDF file.
     "\fB-interconn {all | none | noport | noinport | nooutport}\fR"
    Specifies which interconnect delays to write.    Default:
    all .RS  "*" 2 all - Writes all INTERCONN delays into the
    SDF file. This is the default if the -interconn option is
    not specified. .RE .RS  "*" 2 none - No INTERCONN delays
    are written into the SDF file. .RE .RS  "*" 2 noport - No
    top level port INTERCONN delays are written into the SDF
    file. .RE .RS  "*" 2 nooutport - Disables only the output
    port INTERCONN delays. .RE   "\fB-map_file {file1 file2 ...}\fR"
    Specifies a list of map files. The map files can be used
    to determine what is written into the SDF files. For example,
    a map file can provide delay information on internal pins
    which are not defined in the timing library.  Syntax for
    a map file (for a cell) is as follows: .RS .RS  "*" 2 A template
    section (the text to output) that reference variables of
    the form $<number> .RE  .RE .RS .RS  "*" 2 A variable definition
    section that tells the expression to evaluate to obtain the
    value .RE  .RE   "\fB-max_view <viewName>\fR" Uses the late
    delay from the specified analysis view to populate the SDF
    max slot, when in multi-mode multi-corner analysis mode.
      "\fB-merge_arcs\fR" Merges two arcs that are related to
    the same internal pin and forms one timing arc. For example,
    consider a cell's IOPATH that forms an arc from pin I to
    internal pin A and another from pin A to output pin O. In
    this case, if you use the -merge_arcs option, the software
    will merge both the arcs related to internal pin A and form
    one timing arc from pin I to output pin O.  Note: The -merge_arcs
    parameter is obsolete and has been replaced by the -collapse_internal_pins
    parameter. This parameter still works in this release, but
    to ensure compatibility with future releases, update your
    script to use -collapse_internal_pins parameter.  "\fB-min_clock_threshold
    <number>\fR" Specifies the absolute minimum delta delay change
    threshold on the clock path to be written into the SDF file.
     Time unit is in seconds.  Default: 1e-20  "\fB-min_data_threshold
    <number>\fR" Specifies the absolute minimum delta delay change
    threshold on the data path to be written into the SDF file.
     Time unit is in seconds.  Default: 1e-20  "\fB-min_period_edges
    {posedge | negedge | both | none}\fR" Specifies how to write
    out minimum PERIOD checks. Two check arcs are always created
    for the min_period check when you read in a .lib file. The
    following options let you keep or remove the positive edge,
    the negative edge, both edges, or no edges from the PERIOD
    statement in the .sdf file. .RS  "*" 2 posedge - Writes out
    one positive edge PERIOD check. .RE .RS  "*" 2 negedge -
    Writes out one negative edge PERIOD check. .RE .RS  "*" 2
    both - Writes out both the positive edge and the negative
    edge PERIOD checks. This is the default. .RE .RS  "*" 2 none
    - Writes out one PERIOD check without any edge specifier.
    .RE   "\fB-min_view <viewName>\fR" Uses the early delay from
    the specified analysis view to populate the SDF min slot,
    when in multi-mode multi-corner analysis mode.  "\fB-multi_drive_net_syntax
    <string>\fR" Specifies the multi-drive nets as ports or interconnects.
     You can use the interconnect and port options if you need
    to define the net delays of multi-driven nets (clock mesh)
    as interconnects or ports respectively in the SDF.  "\fB-no_derate\fR"
    Writes non-derated delays to the Standard Delay Format (SDF)
    file. By default, the set_timing_derate command writes scaled
    delays to the SDF file.  When the -no_derate parameter is
    specified, the write_sdf command removes all the applied
    derates.  "\fB-no_escape\fR" Writes out object names without
    escaping hierarchical dividers. Normally, when writing out
    a SDF file, the hierarchical divider (/) is escaped because
    it is a special character.  "\fB-no_variation\fR" Exports
    the SDF delay and check values without including the variation
    component, when the selected analysis type is SOCV.  By default,
    the SDF delays and check values will have the mean + N*sigma
    value.   "\fB-nonegchecks\fR" Converts all negative timing
    check values to 0.0.  The -nonegchecks parameter has an effect
    only when the negative checks are legal. In SDF v3.0, the
    negative checks are only legal in the context of RECREM or
    SETUPHOLD checks - they are not legal in case of split checks.
     In SDC v2.1, the negative values are permitted in SETUP,
    HOLD, and RECOVERY checks. Therefore, for these checks the
    -nonegchecks parameter is required to convert negative values
    to zero. The negative checks are legal in the split checks,
    so the -nonegchecks parameter can have an effect. The SDF
    v2.1, however, does not support REMOVAL checks.  "\fB-path
    <name>  \fR" Specifies the sub-block name.  "\fB-precision
    <non_neg_integer>\fR" Controls the number of digits appearing
    after the decimal point in the output SDF file. The default
    precision is the value of the report_precision.  "\fB-process\fR"
    Specifies one or a combination of the following process names
    that will appear in the header of the generated SDF file:
    .RS  "*" 2 best .RE .RS  "*" 2 typical .RE .RS  "*" 2 worst
    .RE   Use the colon delimiter to specify multiple process
    names. For example:  -process best:typical:worst  In the
    above example, the header of the generated SDF file will
    contain:  (PROCESS "best:typical:worst")  "\fB-recompute_delay_calc\fR"
    Instructs the software to recompute any necessary data required
    for a complete SDF file before exporting.  "\fB-recompute_parallel_arcs\fR"
    Instructs the software to temporarily recompute delays with
    separate  delay calculation for parallel arcs.  The software
    normally operates in a high performance mode which optimizes
    the handling of multiple timing arcs between input and output
    pin pairs. By default, the SDF file generated will contain
    the same delay information for all of these arcs. To have
    the SDF recalculated with explicit pin pair data, you should
    use the option -recompute_parallel_arcs to cause delays for
    each parallel arc to be explicitly calculated. It is recommended
    to use this option for generating SDF for functional simulation
    applications.  Note: When you use the write_sdf -recompute_parallel_arcs
    option timing analysis is performed again. You need to obtain
    a new delay calculation to generate the SDF, and another
    delay calculation to put the system back to where it was
    before write_sdf was specified. Since delay calculation is
    run again, timing analysis will be reset.  Note: The -recompute_parallel_arcs
    parameter is obsolete. This parameter still works in this
    release, but to ensure compatibility with future releases
    update your scripts to use the -recompute_delay_calc parameter
    instead.  "\fB-recrem [merge_always | split | merge_when_paired]\fR"
    Determines how RECOVERY and REMOVAL timing checks are written.
    .RS  "*" 2 merge_always - Always writes combined RECREM checks,
    even if either a RECOVERY, or a REMOVAL, check does not exist.
      For example, if a RECOVERY check exists, but a REMOVAL
    check does not, the software writes a combined RECREM check
    in the SDF file as follows:  RECREM (<value>) (<value>) ()
    () .RE .RS  "*" 2 split - Splits the RECREM checks into a
    RECOVERY check and a REMOVAL check. .RE .RS  "*" 2 merge_when_paired
    - Writes combined RECREM checks only when both a RECOVERY
    and a REMOVAL check exist.   For example, if both a RECOVERY
    and a REMOVAL check exist, the software writes a combined
    RECREM check in the SDF file as follows:  RECREM (<value>)
    (<value>) (<value>) (<value> )   However, if a RECOVERY check
    exists, but a REMOVAL check does not, the software only writes
    the RECOVERY check in the SDF file:  RECOVERY (<value>) (<value>)
    .RE   Default: merge_always  Note: The RECREM sum should
    be zero or greater than zero. A negative value will be adjusted
    to enforce this condition. This is an SDF v3.0 requirement
    (the software may issue a warning).  "\fB-remashold\fR" Converts
    the SDF v2.1 unsupported REMOVAL (and the REMOVAL portion
    of the RECREM constructs) to HOLD checks when used with the
    -version 2.1 option.   Default: Not to write out the unsupported
    checks.  Converts the REMOVAL checks to HOLD checks when
    combined with the -version 3.0 option.The RECREM checks are
    split into a RECOVERY check and a HOLD check. This option
    automatically splits the RECREM checks.    Default: To maintain
    the version 3.0 checks.  "\fB-scale  <float>\fR" Specifies
    a multiplier to the delay values used in the SDF file. This
    option does not change the timescale setting of the SDF file.
    The delay values are scaled, but the units are the same.
      Default: 1  "\fB-setuphold [merge_always | split | merge_when_paired]\fR"
    Determines how SETUP and HOLD timing checks are written.
    .RS  "*" 2 merge_always - Always writes combined SETUPHOLD
    checks, even if either a SETUP or a HOLD, check does not
    exist.   For example, if a SETUP check exists, but a HOLD
    check does not, the software writes a combined SETUPHOLD
    check in the SDF file as follows:  SETUPHOLD (<value>) (<value>)
    () () .RE .RS  "*" 2 split - Splits the SETUPHOLD timing
    checks into separate SETUP and HOLD checks. .RE .RS  "*"
    2 merge_when_paired - Writes combined SETUPHOLD checks only
    when both a SETUP and a HOLD check exist.   For example,
    if both a SETUP and a HOLD check exist, the software writes
    a combined SETUPHOLD check in the SDF file as follows:  SETUPHOLD
    (<value>) (<value>) (<value>) (<value> )   However, if a
    SETUP check exists, but a HOLD check does not, the software
    only writes the SETUP check in the SDF file:  SETUP (<value>)
    (<value>) .RE   Default: merge_always  "\fB-splitrecrem\fR"
    Splits the RECREM checks into a RECOVERY check and a REMOVAL
    check.  Default: To write the combined RECREM check.  Note:
    Use this option only with the version 3.0 option.  "\fB-splitsetuphold\fR"
    Splits the SETUPHOLD timing checks into separate SETUP and
    HOLD checks.  Default: To write the combined SETUPHOLD checks.
     Note: In SDC v3.0, the negative values are illegal in SETUP,
    HOLD, RECOVERY, and REMOVAL checks. Therefore, the negative
    values are converted to zero automatically with the -splitsetuphold
    and -splitrecrem parameters.  "\fB-target_application { sta
    | verilog}\fR" Allows customization of the SDF output for
    use with STA or Verilog applications. You can select the
    following options: .RS  "*" 2 sta: You can use the sta option
    to configure the SDF output for use with static-timing analysis
    (STA) applications. This includes sign-off timing analysis
    with products, such as Cadence Tempus, as well as for working
    with implementation flows that use STA for internal timing
    analysis. The sta option preserves maximum accuracy and generates
    SDF output that matches the structure of the Liberty timing
    libraries.  This option is equivalent to the following options:
      write_sdf -interconn all, -celltiming all, -edges edged,
    -setuphold merge_when_paired, and -recrem  merge_when_paired.
    .RE .RS  "*" 2 verilog: You can use the verilog option to
    generate SDF output that is compatible with Cadence Verilog-XL
    or Verilog-NC simulators.  This option is equivalent to the
    following options:  write_sdf -filter -edges check_edge,
    -setuphold  merge_when_paired, -recrem merge_when_paired,
    -min_period_edges -none, -collapse_internal_pins, and -recompute_parallel_arcs.
    .RE   When the -target_application option is not specified
    then by default SDF output is configured for use with STA
    applications.  "\fB-gate_level_sim_model\fR" Writes out the
    GLS SDF file.   "\fB-temperature\fR" Defines the temperature
    values that will appear in the header of the generated SDF
    file.  Use the colon delimiter to specify multiple temperature
    values. For example:  -temperature -40.0:25.0:125  In the
    above example, the header of the generated SDF file will
    contain:  (TEMPERATURE -40.0:25.0:125)  "\fB-timescale <string>\fR"
    Specifies the units of time in ns (nanoseconds) or ps (picoseconds).
     When -si option is used, the default -timescale value is
    ps.  "\fB-transform_out_to_out_arcs\fR" Writes out all output-to-output
    timing arcs as input-to-output arcs. Input-to-output arc
    delays are computed by adding the delay from the input pin
    to one of the output pins plus the delay from that output
    pin to the other output pin. For instance, in the following
    figure, the delay between in and out2 would be the sum of
    delay1 and delay2.   (<Image> To view the image, refer to
    the Tempus Text Command Reference - Release 20.2 manual.)
      "\fB-typ_view <viewName>\fR" Uses the late delay from the
    specified analysis view to populate the SDF typ slot, when
    in multi-mode multi-corner analysis mode.  "\fB-version {2.1
    | 3.0}\fR" Specifies whether to generate the SDF V2.1 or
    V3.0. The default SDF version is 3.0. Used in combination
    with the -remashold option.  "\fB-view <viewName>\fR" Uses
    the early and late delays for the specified analysis view
    to populate the min and max SDF triplet slots, when in multi-mode
    multi-corner analysis mode. The SDF typ slot remains empty
    (<earlyVal> :: <lateVal>).  In multi-mode multi-corner analysis
    mode, if you want to use SPEF information when calculating
    the delays, you must use read_spef -rc_corner to import the
    SPEF files for each RC corner in the design.  "\fB-voltage\fR"
    Defines the voltage values that will appear in the header
    of the generated SDF file.  Use the colon delimiter to specify
    multiple voltage values. For example:  -voltage 1.980:1.800:1.620
     In the above example, the header of the generated SDF file
    will contain:  (VOLTAGE 1.980:1.800:1.620)  "\fB-worst_case_illegal_cond_arcs
    <string>\fR" Specifies the sdf_cond - all, none, delays,
    or checks - for the arcs.  When this parameter is specified,
    the write_sdf command detects illegal SDF condition syntax
    coming from the Liberty library and generates an unconditional
    annotation in the SDF file that worst-cases the delays of
    the related timing arcs. This prevents downstream tools (such
    as, Verilog simulators) from complaining about illegal syntax
    in the SDF file.  .P Definition of -edges Option Values

    When
    path
    delay
    exceptions
    are
    asserted
    (using
    the
    set_min_delay
    or
    set_max_delay
    commands)
    with
    a
    complete
    -from

    specification,
    the
    exception
    can
    be
    applied
    between
    any
    two
    data
    path
    pins.
    If
    the
    constraint
    assertion
    includes
    only
    a
    -from
    and/or
    -through
    argument,
    then
    a
    set
    of
    valid
    endpoints
    must
    be
    established
    to
    define
    the
    constrained
    paths.
    This
    global
    variable
    allows
    you
    to
    configure
    the
    set
    of
    valid
    endpoints
    (inferred
    -to
    pins)
    that
    are
    selected.
    
    When
    set
    to
    false,
    the
    set
    of
    allowed
    endpoints
    is
    simply
    all
    of
    the
    endpoints
    in
    the
    combinational
    fanout
    of
    the
    -from
    and/or
    -through
    arguments
    -
    essentially,
    wherever
    the
    path
    tracing
    stops.
    The
    path
    delay
    constraint
    will
    be
    applied
    as
    if
    there
    were
    a
    -to
    argument
    specified
    for
    each
    endpoint.
    
    When
    set
    to
    true,
    the
    software
    uses
    different
    rules
    to
    determine
    the
    valid
    set
    of
    inferred
    -to
    endpoints.
    Only
    constrained
    pins
    in
    the
    fanout
    of
    -from
    and/or
    -through
    arguments
    are
    considered
    as
    valid
    -to
    endpoints
    for
    the
    constraint.
    A
    constrained
    endpoint
    will
    have
    some
    type
    of
    timing
    check
    -
    such
    as
    Setup
    or
    Hold
    already
    in
    force
    on
    that
    pin.
    Additionally,
    each
    transition
    at
    the
    endpoints
    will
    be
    examined
    to
    determine
    if
    each
    is
    individually
    constrained.
    The
    path
    exception
    will
    only
    be
    applied
    to
    the
    edges
    that
    are
    constrained.
    As
    an
    example,
    if
    a
    register
    preset
    or
    a
    clear
    pin
    was
    a
    potential
    endpoint,
    then
    only
    the
    edge
    constrained
    by
    the
    recovery
    or
    removal
    check
    will
    have
    the
    path
    delay
    applied.
    To
    apply
    the
    path
    delay
    constraint
    to
    unconstrained
    endpoints
    while
    in
    this
    mode,
    you
    must
    specify
    them
    explicitly
    with
    the

    breaking.
    .P
    By
    default
    (false),
    when
    the
    timing
    engine
    encounters
    combinational
    loops
    in
    the
    design,
    it
    breaks
    the
    loop
    by
    disabling
    a
    timing
    arc
    along
    the
    path.
    The
    heuristics
    used
    in
    breaking
    the
    loop
    cannot
    guarantee
    that
    a
    real
    path
    through
    the
    disabled
    arc
    will
    not
    be
    blocked
    as
    a
    consequence.
    Therefore,
    users
    must
    carefully
    investigate
    the
    arcs
    that
    have
    been
    disabled
    to
    ascertain
    that
    the
    loop
    break
    was
    done
    safely.
    If
    loop
    breaks
    are
    not
    then
    added
    to
    the
    master
    constraint
    file,
    they
    could
    move
    to
    other
    locations
    as
    the
    design
    matures.
    .P
    When
    set
    to
    true,
    the
    timing
    system
    performs
    a
    more
    sophisticated

    of

    that
    no

    are
    broken
    inadvertently

    The

    are
    reported
    with

    pins
    of
    the

    path.
    For
    example,
    for
    a
    register
    the
    begin
    pin
    is
    register's
    CK
    pin
    and
    the
    end
    pin
    is

    D

    is

    path's
    begin

    All
    the
    pins
    using
    -from/-to
    are
    treated

    Therefore,
    a

    is
    reported
    with
    register's
    Q
    pin
    as
    a

    Or

    still
    be
    reported
    to
    correct
    start/end
    pins
