**WARN: (IMPDB-2504):	Unable to find netlist cell in the design data of the library or LEF. The 'BUFX1' cell is instantiated in the Verilog netlist, but not defined in the library or design data.  Its pin directions might be derived incorrectly. Include the cell definition or its pin information in the library or design data and reload the design to avoid potential issues.
**WARN: (UI-418):	Undefined cells that are instantiated in the netlist are allowed because load_netlist_ignore_undefined_cell is true. Unexpected results may occur due to missing library data or missing netlist data. For accurate results, provide a consistent library and netlist.
